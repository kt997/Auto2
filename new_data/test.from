(1) Not directly, though I don't recall any of the explanatory examples used in the Groundwork being based on fleshed-out real world scenarios. He also mentions morality judgments being *a priori*, and based on what you said about Korsgaard's statements, that makes me think that most of what his moral philosophy is doing is advising us on hypothetical cases, rather than covering real-world cases extensively. newlinechar  newlinechar (2) Sorry, what I meant to ask was 'if the Categorical Imperative is just hypothetical, then how do we know that people actually use it when they are acting morally?' And how do we know this other than by Kant's arguments?

As I said in my original comment, please take time alone. Please don't use her right now. You're 23, which is coming up on a pretty mature age to be able to handle being single for a bit and taking care of yourself after a breakup. You clearly sound like you hate being alone and need to have a girl in your life. This is not a good way to live, and it's only going to lead to more failed relationships in the future. Get over the breakup by yourself. Feel the pain, sadness, frustration, heartbreak, anger, whatever you feel. Don't rush it, and just let it all come to you, and leave with time. When you're past this, you're going to be stronger and smarter than you are now. You don't want to be any older and still feeling lonely without a girl in your life. It's just not healthy and not smart. I know guys like that who are 28, 30, who are bouncing from relationships to rebounds to relationships to a fling to a rebound to a relationship and it's honestly sad and pathetic. I think now, at your age, is a good time to really learn to enjoy your own company, the best kind of company to keep! That way, when you do get into a relationship when you're ready, you're going to be so secure, so not jealous, so ready to give love, so ready to receive what you want, and feel happier than ever before. So, I don't recommend jumping to this girl that's been waiting for you. It's not respectful to her (you're just using her as company because you're sad, not because you really want to get to know her).

Whenever I get a package of plain M&amp;Ms, I make it my duty to continue the strength and robustness of the candy as a species. To this end, I hold M&amp;M duels.¬†Taking two candies between my thumb and forefinger, I apply pressure, squeezing them together until one of them cracks and splinters. That is the ‚Äúloser,‚Äù and I eat the inferior one immediately. The winner gets to go another round.¬†I have found that, in general, the brown and red M&amp;Ms are tougher, and the newer blue ones are genetically inferior. I have hypothesized that the blue M&amp;Ms as a race cannot survive long in the intense theater of competition that is the modern candy and snack-food world.¬†Occasionally I will get a mutation, a candy that is misshapen, or pointier, or flatter than the rest. Almost invariably this proves to be a weakness, but on very rare occasions it gives the candy extra strength. In this way, the species continues to adapt to its environment.¬†When I reach the end of the pack, I am left with one M&amp;M, the strongest of the herd. Since it would make no sense to eat this one as well, I pack it neatly in an envelope and send it to M&amp;M Mars, A Division of Mars, Inc., Hackettstown, NJ 17840-1503 U.S.A., along with a 3√ó5 card reading, ‚ÄúPlease use this M&amp;M for breeding purposes.‚Äù¬†This week they wrote back to thank me, and sent me a coupon for a free 1/2 pound bag of plain M&amp;Ms. I consider this ‚Äúgrant money.‚Äù I have set aside the weekend for a grand tournament.

It's not too sensitive of a topic, if you can't talk about paedophilia or sex with children this stuff ends up as taboo, and the stigma continues, which is not what we want!  newlinechar  newlinechar And bro, I agree with you, why would I care if people are attracted to children when they have no intention to act upon it, potentially helped by therapeutic support, it's like people with crazy fetishes etc, why would I care?  newlinechar  newlinechar And it's important that people who *are* attracted to children feel free to talk about it, because in the current state of society they cannot, like you say it's a sensitive topic, but when people cannot talk about it they keep their problems to themselves, allowing it to brood or escalate, perhaps resulting in the *behaviour* that is the unacceptable part of the mental disorder paedophilia, if people with paedophilia feel safe and free to talk about it and look for help (without people or the media portraying them as monsters or predators), there'd be less incidence of sex offences against children newlinechar  newlinechar Let's hope that 2018 helps diminish the stigma against mental health!

I've been doing lazy keto as well as my boyfriend. I've done research and while I've only been at this since November 1st, (ok had a set back for 3 days during Christmas) my biggest struggle has been making sure I'm getting enough fat in my diet. In order for your body to start burning fat for energy, you have to eliminate sugars and really minimize your carb intake. I always have avocados at home to eat with my meals. Intermittent fasting is another great way to help with weight loss. I did have a stall after my initial few lbs loss, however my clothes felt a lot looser. Once your body starts burning your fat residuals, water fills the fat cells which takes up less space. So you may not see a huge change in the scale, but you can notice changes. However, if you're dehydrated, your body will retain water. Drinks lots and lots of water! If you have a fit bit, you can log your water intake and set a goal. Or, download a free app for your phone and set timed reminders for yourself. I find it helps if you have a water bottle that holds say, 20oz of water, and set a goal for yourself daily. Having water on hand at all time makes it a lot easier. All i drink is coffee and water. Best of luck; don't get discouraged! Keep at it :)

It just makes it that more satisfying to me when I destroy them to be honest. Every tier has its top dog and there will always be tanks who struggle against it. While I do think the MBT/KPZ-70 and T-64A should be at BR 9.3, I also accept that it prob won't happen for a while and that Gaijin always takes thier sweet time addressing balance things. The main arguement before about top tier was that it was point and click and armor didn't matter. They introduce the T-64A (and Cheif Mk.10 to an extent) and now the main complaint is that they can use their armor (against BR 8.3 and lower tanks) and they should be uptiered so they can't use their armor anymore. At that point I wonder why exactly introduce these tanks then.

Not sure where you are hearing it. The rebuild time for my 8TB WD Reds in a 10x8TB RAIDZ2 is about 7 hours, and they are about 50% full.

The rebuild runs at around 150MB/s writing to the replacement disk (which is about the average write speed across my particular disks).  If I were to configure them in mirrors, a rebuild actually takes longer because there would be more data on each disk since the capacity in mirror configuration is lower.

It'll be tough though. Lebron's first half of his career was wasted (relatively). Jordan's team was good as fuck and still good without him when he left for that stint. I also wonder how he'd do if he had to face a team like GSW. If Lebron beats this iteration of GSW, he's GOAT for me no question. Lebron has been an underdog in most of his finals iirc (and will be this year if he makes it again) which is insane. He's faced some seriously historically great teams and for 2 of his finals he was very undermanned. The only one he should've won and didn't was 2011 and unfortunately some people never let that go. Was Jordan's team ever the underdog?

Imma have to disagree with you on this. DON'T mix Tylenol and alcohol. Tylenol produces a toxic metabolite (iminoquinone) which glutathione is used to get rid of it. This same glutathione is used to detoxify the toxic metabolite of alcohol (acetylaldehyde). Hence.. if you use them both together, you won't have enough glutathione for both toxic metabolites which could be deadly to your liver.  newlinechar  newlinechar If you HAVE to choose one, I'd say go with Naproxen-- it's very similar to Ibuprofen but has a longer half life. I wouldn't recommend either ibuprofen nor naproxen with alcohol, but I'd definitely choose those over using acetaminophen. I don't think naproxen really works against the fever however.  newlinechar  newlinechar Frankly, I'd just continuously drink gatorade while you're drinking and make sure you drink a ton of it before sleeping. Wake up a little early, drink a ton more and go back to bed and you should be good go (at least that works for me)  newlinechar  newlinechar Also, the current guidelines (unless they recently changed) is 3000 mg of Tylenol over 24 hours. Not saying if you take that much it's automatic liver failure, but that's the last I've heard

&gt;These examples are from other countries.  newlinechar  newlinechar The first one is, the second one is from interviews conducted all over America and is particularly of interest to me because of the firsthand experiences that were shared. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;In my personal experience, the hatred towards butch women is more from women themselves.  newlinechar  newlinechar Women are absolutely complicit in throwing GNC AFAB people (and FtMs) under the bus but they don't participate in the same culture of sexual violence against them to nearly the same degree. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Sometimes you get cockbite guys who have an issue, but they mostly ignore than make outright threats. If men do make outright threats, it's more because of rape culture/misogyny. newlinechar  newlinechar The physical and sexual threats I've received both when I presented as a GNC woman in my youth and later when I came out as trans were overwhelmingly from guys. I learned pretty early on that being in places at school where I could be cornered by guys was dangerous, because those were the places where young men thought they could overpower and threaten me with sexual/physical assault. As I grew older and started passing and living life as a passing but openly trans man the nature of the threats changed from 'I'm going to rape you until you accept your inner feminine nature' to a weird, disgusting mix of 'I'm going to rape you until you accept that you're a *woman*' and outright homophobia, treating me like some weird homuculus mixture of '*true* woman' and 'yeah but he's pretty masc so this feels kinda gay'. newlinechar  newlinechar I've read some of your other comments though and I don't know that I'd like to continue a conversation with you unless you can tone that shit down. Talk about being rude and dismissive, not only of nonbinary people ('transmasculine' is being used by those of us who don't wish to alienate those who don't feel comfortably in the binary) but of the trans male experience in general. There's always at least one of this type of person who try to push back against the lived experiences of trans men and simultaneously claim that any violence that happens to us is for any reason *besides* transphobia or violence for being perceived as GNC, and yet also claim that there *is* no real issues of violence going on either. newlinechar  newlinechar It's not a race to who is most oppressed, I and most other trans men will be the first to say that yes, trans women have it worse on several issues, but the community has ended up pushing this rhetoric *to the exclusion* of trans men. Trans men are more likely to be the poorest of the poor in society. Trans men are more likely to attempt suicide. Trans men report having more issues in the medical system in some ways including not receiving transition related care. Etc. Etc. Etc. Somehow 'trans women are more visible and therefore have some more visible issues' has turned into an attitude of 'trans men have no problems and basically have amazing transitions and never experience transphobia or really any problems of note and any trans guy who speaks up is just a whiny fuck trying to steal resources away from trans women'. newlinechar  newlinechar If that's coming at it from a 'distinctly feminine conditioning' (seriously what the fuck dude, talk about misogyny), well then fuck me I guess. We talk about rape because it's a huge problem in the FtM community that is swept under the carpet and ignored almost entirely by the larger community and even the FtM community sometimes. newlinechar  newlinechar We *are* invisible, but invisible doesn't mean un-victimizable. It just means the violence and assault committed against us is as ignored and invisible as we are.

My friends who used LED told me they are better for Veg...and they are so expensive and over-hyped...just the pure flowering power behind an HID is pretty undeniable.

Perhaps, but as a (retired!) bartender who worked in a couple of small bars the police activity gives the bar a bad name and draws the attention of the liquor board, a group of people you *don't* want taking notice of troublesome activity.

The cat fact is not true, and since I'm 30 minutes late, I have to post it down here so anyone will see it. newlinechar  newlinechar The refutation goes like this: We hear about cats surviving massive falls, so we assume cats can survive massive falls. newlinechar  newlinechar Cats have survived falls. But the most common case is for a cat to fall to their death, and for us not to hear about it because they're dead and it's still pretty rare. newlinechar  newlinechar This is an instance of [Survivor Bias](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Qd3erAPI9w) and explains a lot of things, like why people try to move to hollywood to become actors even though only ~10 people get famous per year out of tens of thousands. Or why people try to start billion-dollar startups ‚Äì thousands of companies, all aiming to be worth &gt;$1b, and all convinced they're on that track ‚Äì even though it's remarkably rare to actually start such a company. newlinechar  newlinechar Also Reddit, fix your stupid algorithm so that new comments appear at the top for a very short while so that they can gather upvotes instead of instantly hiding them at the bottom of threads regardless of how good they are. HN has been kicking your ass at this for a decade now and it's ridiculous you haven't stolen their good ideas. newlinechar  newlinechar EDIT: [Posted below by IICVX](https://www.reddit.com/r/SweatyPalms/comments/7nb0og/9_lives_cats_eyes/ds0p0vi/): newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; It turns out cats generally do well [if they fall from either less than 2 stories or greater than 6 stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-rise_syndrome). Less than that and they tend to survive because they're basically a liquid, more than that they tend to survive because they can deploy their inner flying squirrel.  newlinechar  newlinechar And since &gt;2 stories or &lt;6 stories is a common case, that's why falling can be deadly to cats. newlinechar  newlinechar EDIT2: My previous edit was incorrect, and that should tell you something about the forces at work here. newlinechar  newlinechar Watch the video. He makes a convincing case that this cat fact is straight up wrong. It's not true that cats can *usually* survive falls from &gt;6 stories. We just don't hear from the ones that splat. newlinechar  newlinechar It's very interesting just how powerful survivorship bias is. Look at all the replies saying how wrong it is, and genuinely defending that cats do not splat if you drop them from a massive distance. That they somehow become flying squirrels because they have time to relax in mid air. The very idea is ridiculous, and *of course* it's false. newlinechar  newlinechar But even while I was writing this originally, I still second guessed myself and read a reply and put in an edit like 'Well, it's actually &gt;2 stories but &lt;6 stories.' What? No. Cats die from falling just like humans. They're smaller, so it's less fatal. But it's still usually fatal. newlinechar  newlinechar You won't find a scientific study confirming this. Just like you won't find a study confirming the efficacy of parachutes. *Of course* you die without a parachute, just like cats. But you don't need a study to realize this. newlinechar  newlinechar But let's not drop cats to find out, ok? :) There are some things humans shouldn't try to prove. newlinechar

Movies are a form of entertainment designed to move and impact an audience through visual and sound. This can generally be captured through a rating system.  newlinechar  newlinechar Therefore, if the Star Wars prequels were 'superior' wouldn't the grand majority of people - the audience - agree and rate those films at a higher number than the originals? What's the disconnect? Are the grand, grand majority of Star Wars fans stupid and don't know great art when they see it?  newlinechar

Just in case you're not trolling, which I believe you are: That's the point. You don't get the Membership Benefits if you're not a member of the club. You don't get any of the friend groups alcohol if you can never contribute to the money pool for buying it. You get the idea. If the members of an organization want to get something out of their member status, then the system can only serve that function if it's members give something back to sustain it.
That's not the problem. The problem is that every game starts out as, by default, being about a man, by men, and for men. Games as an art form lack female creators and voices, which means they lose out on truly female characters and stories, which makes the medium weaker as an art form and also part of the cultural trend of not respecting the voices and experiences of women.
may i ask why you are waiting a year or two to overclock? i think a lot of people fear overclocking and the 'myth' that it shortens your hardware's lifespan. yes running your components higher and hotter will degrade the lifespan of your card but you will surly upgrade your graphics card long before that point happens

&gt; But Eastern Europe is a real place with real people in it. newlinechar  newlinechar Yes, *and millions of them miss socialism*: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;A remarkable 72% of Hungarians say that most people in their country are actually worse off today economically than they were under communism. Only 8% say most people in Hungary are better off, and 16% say things are about the same. In no other Central or Eastern European country surveyed did so many believe that economic life is worse now than during the communist era. This is the result of almost universal displeasure with the economy. Fully 94% describe the country's economy as bad, the highest level of economic discontent in the hard hit region of Central and Eastern Europe. Just 46% of Hungarians approve of their country's switch from a state-controlled economy to a market economy; 42% disapprove of the move away from communism. The public is even more negative toward Hungary's integration into Europe; 71% say their country has been weakened by the process. newlinechar  newlinechar http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2010/04/28/hungary-better-off-under-communism/ newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;The most incredible result was registered in a July 2010 IRES (Romanian Institute for Evaluation and Strategy) poll, according to which 41% of the respondents would have voted for Ceausescu, had he run for the position of president. And 63% of the survey participants said their life was better during communism, while only 23% attested that their life was worse then. Some 68% declared that communism was a good idea, just one that had been poorly applied. newlinechar  newlinechar http://www.balkanalysis.com/romania/2011/12/27/in-romania-opinion-polls-show-nostalgia-for-communism/ newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Glorification of the German Democratic Republic is on the rise two decades after the Berlin Wall fell.

Georgians are divided. newlinechar  newlinechar http://news.gallup.com/poll/166538/former-soviet-countries-harm-breakup.aspx newlinechar  newlinechar Why is this surprising? Life expectancy dropped like a lead weight after the fall of the USSR; alcoholism, mental illness, and suicide rates skyrocketed.

Had they the guts and willpower, they could have launched an October Revolution 2.0. They had the support for it. newlinechar  newlinechar It is you that treats Eastern Europeans like a liberal fantasy, where Everyone Is Uniformly In Agreement that ~~Voldemort~~ the USSR is bad. newlinechar  newlinechar It's almost like the Eastern Bloc wasn't the dystopian nightmare people think it was. newlinechar  newlinechar Guess what? Even the shittiest Eastern Bloc countries who even *I* won't defend (i.e. Romania) had guaranteed housing, healthcare, food, education, and jobs. And it didn't come at the cost of propping up apartheid and various right wing death squads across the world, unlike America, which has all the wealth free slave labor and genocidal colonization can buy you, still somehow can't manage to ensure that diabetics don't die because they can't afford fucking insulin, or that homeless people have homes even though vacant homes outnumber them ~7 to 1. newlinechar  newlinechar (Inb4 you abandon any pretense of caring about Eastern Europeans like actual human beings and start referring to them as a children incapable of deciding what's actually best for them; or as Kissinger said, 'I don't see why we need to stand by and watch a country go communist due to the irresponsibility of its people. The issues are much too important for the Chilean voters to be left to decide for themselves.')

I think for the time being the subreddit is not in a position to censor views because of where they may originate from.

Keep in mind that less than a day into the creation of a subreddit it's hard to say which direction it may take and the culture of the subreddit is still forming. If this subreddit devolves to a point where it is no longer conducive to discussion of the subject at hand, or becomes about the protests from a US-centric point of view, then it will be time for restrictions. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm always open to suggestions and have been looking for people to help me moderate this sub as its growing at an immense pace.

***This is a recent post I made to the forum for the Conclave of Aldemeria worldbuilding Minecraft server about the ruling Houses of my realm.*** newlinechar  newlinechar There are many noble and non-noble ruling Houses of Vi√∞rlond. As of 45 YC, there are 6 noble houses, and numerous non-noble houses with 3 of those considered important enough to warrant discussion in this document.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar **House Vi√∞rcynn** newlinechar  newlinechar House Vi√∞rcynn reigns as the supreme noble house of the realm of Vi√∞rlond. Originally the Hlaford of Ent Farthing, House Vi√∞rcynn has for some time ruled over the other Houses of the current realm. Their crest contains an √ñstron runic symbol that contains the runes for trees, and the runic symbol for all √ñstron tribes. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar **House Fleotwudu** newlinechar  newlinechar House Fleotwudu rules as the noble house of Smarragd. House Fleotwudu has long been considered a branch of House Vi√∞rcynn, as their long history of marriages has give each house claims on one another's thrones. Should the Vi√∞rcynn line die out, it is like the rest of the realm would accept a Fleotwudu Hlaford as the new ruler of the realm. Their crest contains the √ñstron runes for the letters 'F' and 'W'. newlinechar  newlinechar   newlinechar **House Truhtcynn** newlinechar  newlinechar House Truhtcynn is a non-noble house that is notable due to their few marriages to various leaders of House Vi√∞rcynn.

Their crest contains the √ñstron runic symbol turned on its side, stylized like a fish.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar **House Folcwine** newlinechar  newlinechar House Folcwine is a very powerful noble house that rules from Vatnklippe. House Folcwine was the first noble house to pledge fealty to House Vi√∞rcyn (House Fleotwudu was given noble status many centuries after they pledged fealty). Their crest contains the √ñsron runes for 'V' and 'K.'  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar **House Gaardel** newlinechar  newlinechar House Gaardel was once the chief rival of House Vi√∞rcynn, until a noble marriage sealed their fate as a vassalized noble house. House Gaardel rules from the garden-fortress village of Lustgaard. Their crest contains the ancient symbol of Lustgaard - a central fortress with many sectioned gardens.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar **House Hw√¶talu** newlinechar  newlinechar House Hw√¶talu is a non-noble house that rules from the hamlet of Hw√¶teford, a significant wheat producing and trading hamlet long vassalized by House Vi√∞rcynn. Their crest contains the √ñstron rune for the wheat harvest.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar **House Thorbjon** newlinechar  newlinechar House Thorbjon is a new noble house of the forest elves in the west, ruling from Stokkrlundr. Their crest contains their ancient symbol of twin halberds.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar **House Romson** newlinechar  newlinechar House Romson is a non-noble house that rules from the fortress village of Rostgava. A rather new house founded by Thane Wyn Romson, it is expected they shall rise to nobility soon for their efforts in the recent wars. Their crest is the personal symbol of Thane Wyn Romson.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar **House Bl√¶cynn** newlinechar  newlinechar House Bl√¶cynn is a very powerful noble house that House Vi√∞rcynn force vassalized in the recent Great Eastern War. They rule over much of the east of the realm, ruling from the village of Bl√¶cwyrt. Their symbol is the √ñstron rune for a type of tree in combination with the √ñstron rune for 'B.'

The smell test is only accurate if you pour some into a glass, then smell the milk in the glass.  If you smell the bottle, you're smelling the dried milk at the top, which will smell grosser than the milk in the jug.  A lot of people have poured out perfectly fine milk because of this.

The math isn't the problem here, it's the prevailing winds. At the equator, you'd need to be moving at about 1038 MPH along the surface to stay in the same relative position. You can add or subtract prevailing winds from that figure. Needless to say, helicopters can't go that fast. Air moves around the planet at roughly the same speed the planet does. The fastest air can reach up to 250 MPH, between 25-35k feet, known as the jet streams. No matter how you cut it though, your helicopter can't move fast enough. 
Good call, but 1/5 is still better than nothing. If I was super pedantic, I'd have everyone in the party do a different resistance. That way if the whole party got dunked, at least there is a chance someone might not be blown apart like Linda Hamilton's nightmare in Terminator 2.

I assume you didn't start out making $100K.  If so, where did you start out at?

You know how at least central and north Europe is individualistic, everyone's taxed by themselves by now (I think), family is defined as a couple and their children under 18 years of age, and everyone is expected to make their own decisions? newlinechar  newlinechar Seems to me like at least a great part of USA is actually not like that at all, but family-centered, much like .. dunno, Middle East? Children stay around at least until they're married, the family gives their daughter to a worthy man to marry, after which the wives move to their husband's parents' home, which the matriarch and the patriarch run the clan as they please.. Only difference I see is that the gender roles aren't as rigid in USA. Maybe. Or maybe they're just different. I'm still researching. newlinechar  newlinechar Watch something like.. 'Say Yes to the Dress Atlanta' and gasp at all the southern matriarchs that just have to decide everything, the brothers and fathers who make a fuss if their sister shows an elbow in the wedding dress, and the brides who at 25 something years of age still haven't learned to say 'no'.

I've had some success object tracking using the manual tracking in Blender from a single camera, but it's tedious and you need to have accurate camera notes or the solver freaks out.  It's not always going to work, either. My big concern is that you've said white circular markers - does that mean, like, a single band around the arm or something? If so, I doubt you'll get enough useful information from that to actually try for object tracks. I've only really seen it done when you have enough points to get some degree of accuracy. Potentially, if you could track it accurately enough, you could parent bones to the track and get a rough set of animation data as a starting point which you would then finesse manually, I think. newlinechar  newlinechar Please note I'm only really somewhere between hobbyist/semi-professional at best, so I'm not super knowledgeable, but that would be the approach I would consider. But I wouldn't shoot a frame without testing it first and planning everything out in pre-production, because things like motion tracking seem to be pretty specific to get working, let alone making it look great. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: may have misunderstood how you did the markers, very tired when I initially read that. Give it a shot in blender perhaps with the manual tracking - I'm not sure how well it'll go, but I've had some success with it in the past. With motion blur, I imagine the manual tracking will be handy.

I would disagree and suggest that it has much more to do with culture, than it does genetics.  Scofflaw cultures around the world end up in the same band.  Papua New Guineans don't share the same genetics as Zimbabweans but they certainly tolerate/accept a tremendous amount of corruption in their societies. newlinechar  newlinechar Canada and Finland are not genetically similar at all (other than Thunder Bay), but have a similar murder rate.  It may be because of a self reliance brought about by a thrive or freeze mentality. 
So let's lay down some common sense to the idiots to cogitate for a bit. newlinechar  newlinechar You're special forces and you get sent to a situation, you don't go in wondering whether it's a prank or a genuine thing, you go in because there is shit going on. The forces were constantly fed information of the situation, and the latest information they have to work with is newlinechar  newlinechar 1) There are 4 people in the house. 1 dead father, 1 mother and 1 younger brother incapacitated, and 1 older brother who is the aggressor. newlinechar  newlinechar 2) Said aggressor killed his father, and doused the house with gasoline, ready to blow the place (along with the rest of his family) to smithereens at any moment newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Upon breaking into the house, they see an adult show-up. With the information presented above, there is only one logical possibility, that being the murderer who is about to blow the whole place up. They know it won't be the hostage because he wasn't going anywhere, and if he did they'd have been updated of that new fact. newlinechar  newlinechar **What the hell do you expect the officer to do?** newlinechar -------------------- newlinechar In the end this was nothing but a stupid prank turned deadly, and the shithead should get fucked in prison and rot for the rest of his life.

You don't have to declare that you bought a cryptocurrency. You only have to declare to the IRS when you sell because that is the only time that the IRS sees that you made money. They don't monitor crypto values so if you bought a LTC at $50 and now it is at $250, but it is still in LTC form then the IRS doesn't care and you don't have to report it. Just report whenever your USD bank account grows as income. Same as gifts, they don't have to report getting crypto, but if they cash out and get $250 in their bank then they just made $250 and that would be reported as a $250 dollar gift.

Be careful about 'well-paying internships during my summers.' While attainable, they are not just given out to CMU students. You should not expect or depend on securing an internship for financial reasons especially after freshman or sophomore year. newlinechar  newlinechar As for convincing your dad that CMU or some other school is the right choice, I would suggest creating a presentation detailing your key points. Use data and persuasive arguments. Show him that you really thought this through and are serious about this decision. At the same time, you should keep in mind that your father is older and has more experience in the world. While this may indeed introduce biases (choosing his alma mater for sentimental reasons?), it also means that he can, for instance, identify priorities more accurately. Also keep in mind that he is ultimately looking out for you and your brother's best interest. newlinechar  newlinechar Good luck wherever you end up going to school.

&gt; The Empire is all about genetic purity, and it seems like giving them an aversion to LGBT is just another way to make them 'evil' that just seems cliche, but it would fit with them. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't know.

Homosexuals do remove themselves from the gene pool, but the Empire genocides or remodels other sapient species, so the loss of ~4% of the mating population might be ignored (no need to outbreed competitors). Or maybe they 'fixed' it a long time ago and LGBT is seen as another class B minor defect.

Male here: why is this marked NSFW?
Whether or not this is true, many of your reasons for this not being true are potentially harmful ways of looking at this. No, she wouldn't necessarily scream or cry to make abuse stop. She's a child and he's an adult, that can be very silencing in an abusive situation. Just because you don't remember a time that matches the description doesn't mean it didn't exist. If this were an abusive situation, these would be bad reasons to doubt your daughter and pretty hurtful. That said, it's understandable to be skeptical in your situation. Just try to tread carefully in case it is true. Absolutely do not discount the possibility that it's true. Pedophiles are often people we know, like or love.

AMD is probably silent because they actually have a product selling well.

&gt; Accessibility is definitely an issue, some characters have 75 years of stories behind them and most of them have at least 30.  newlinechar  newlinechar Sure, but manga puts out 52 issues per year instead of 12, so like I said, many manga already have more pages to get through than 75 years of comics would produce. Besides, for most of those 75 years, you can read synopsises to get caught up on the major bullet points. It's not like most of the people who have been reading comics over the past few decades started on Action Comics #1, most jumped right into the middle of a storyline without half the resources that a modern reader would have available for catching up. That's not a problem. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I mean how many threads a week do we get on this sub of people asking about where to start for a certain character, which run to start with or even where to start with DC, Marvel, Image, etc. newlinechar  newlinechar Yeah, but again, *that* comes from poor labeling, how a relatively recent series might have 3-5 different 'volume one' trades that each cover a different year's worth of comics. If they did a better job of labeling so that readers would know exactly where each volume fit, they could pick one and work backwards and forwards from there. The issue isn't that the decades of continuity exists, it's that they aren't well *organized.*

How about an across the board tank split by a factor of about 10? Every owned tank turns into 10 tanks and price and profit per each newly purchased tank are reduced by a factor of 10. If they want to reward early adopters a bit, the split into new tanks could be a little above 10, e.g., 11, while the price and profit still just get divided by the 10.

I would argue that while it looks simple on the surface, it's not so simple in reality. newlinechar  newlinechar Consider the following situations where some may be a lost sale and some might not be a lost sale: newlinechar  newlinechar * A person who pirates may never have intended to pay in the first place. No sale lost. newlinechar  newlinechar * A person who pirates may be cheap and doesn't care about developer support and would have bought the game if they didn't have access to piracy. Sale is lost. newlinechar  newlinechar * A person pirates the game who would not have paid to play this game. However, this person advertises this game in some fashion, whether they post a Let's Play or tells his friends what a great game it is. Those people who are exposed to the advertisement end up purchasing the game. Potential sales gained. newlinechar  newlinechar These examples attempt to demonstrate that there are various outcomes that would not exist without piracy. I propose that the mathematical example you provide is too simplistic to arrive at your conclusion that modding/piracy = lost sales. newlinechar  newlinechar As I mentioned in my other comment, there are fairly large sample studies done. Check out https://cdn.netzpolitik.org/wp-upload/2017/09/displacement_study.pdf for why price (where piracy = free) doesn't explain sales declines in the EU.

I think some alt projects are really interesting, including ETH... But as I mentioned I think valuable innovations will eventually be stacked on top of bitcoin. Ethereum's Virtual Machine is a perfect example. It's a novel idea that could prove very useful, and now bitcoin has that functionality byway of a sidechain named Rootsock.  newlinechar  newlinechar I think there are a lot of scams out there, especially be wary of anything with a pre-mine the founders are sitting on... but I don't think they're all jokes. I think the irrational hype-driven markets, however, are a joke. I try to ignore them most of the time as I believe it's just noise in the long run, and I'm not here to get rich quick so I don't care about pump 'n dumps.  newlinechar  newlinechar I think bitcoin will be extremely valuable in the future. I don't have a particular price in mind, but I believe it will be so high it would be hard for us to wrap our brains around right now. Even if you were to mention this time a year ago that bitcoin would be worth what it is today, it'd have been hard for me to wrap my brain around.

Summary:  newlinechar  newlinechar Flying south for polar orbits hasn't been allowed from the Eastern Range since the 60s, when a dispensed first stage supposedly hit and killed a cow in Cuba.

K/D 1.71, W/L 0.76. Reason for this is because I'm going for chrome. Drift0r's video leads me to believe that the SBMM likely punishes those with the low W/L's and decent K/D's. I don't trust a word Condrey says. I've played every CoD since CoD2, played AW for 27 prestiges and I know SHG's filthy SBMM when I see it. What pisses me off the most is the apparent disregard for separating the best players after an unbalanced match. newlinechar  newlinechar BO3 removed SBMM after community uproar within a day after it was implemented.

What /u/CPM17 said. Also, his shooting percentage increased by 20, from 5 to 25, so his goal scoring prowess might be a bit of an aberration. Still, he's been playing great on the line with Marchessault &amp; Reilly and getting more than 4th line TOI must help too.

Yep that's a very good question.  My guess is no.  IMO bitcoin has too many flaws to have a future in service as a viable cryptocurrency.

Definitely reaping. newlinechar  newlinechar However, if you look at the IBJJF rules: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; while keeping the foot of the leg at risk stuck between newlinechar his hip and armpit newlinechar  newlinechar You need to control the foot for it to be considered reaping though. The position can occur naturally in several different ways and it's fine as long as you don't wrap up the ankle. That's only the case if you're both down though, because next part clarifies: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; It is not necessary for one of the athletes to hold the foot newlinechar of his opponent in order for the foot to be considered newlinechar caught or stuck. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; For purposes of this rule, when one athlete is standing and newlinechar bearing their weight on foot of the same leg as the knee newlinechar in danger, the foot will be considered caught or stuck. newlinechar  newlinechar So you can reap as long as A: they aren't standing on that foot and B: you don't control the foot of the leg you're reaping. newlinechar  newlinechar

Honestly, I really enjoyed my first time getting caught out in the dark and bumbling about.  Mainly because it was very memorable.  I remember an NPC warning me about traveling at night, and I just wrote it off as regular RPG type writing and that it wouldn't be a big deal (surely the night wouldn't be all that dark, it never is in games).  Cut to me fumbling around in the dark with a lamp that only lit up a small circle of area around me and hearing wolves howling in the inky blackness beyond sight and me just shitting my pants.  Really cool moment. newlinechar  newlinechar The darkness mechanic was actually one of my favorite bits of the game.  It was amazing to play a game where mysterious underground crypts *didn't* have inexplicable light sources (*cough* Skyrim *cough*).  It made finding shafts of light leaking in from the ceiling or large braziers that could be lit a moment of relief.   newlinechar  newlinechar If there's one thing I hope carries over from the original Draogn's Dogma to the (hopefully someday) sequel, it's that dark is actually dark.

You don't need MEW to transfer TRX out of Binance, you do a direct transfer to your Nano ETH wallet. But you won't see your TRX balance on the Chrome extension, this is where you have to go to MEW and open your Nano on there which for me was the tricky part. So you only need MEW to view it, not move it. But I found where I sent my Tron and it's off the exchange and off my computer entirely. I'm glad I'm hodling because it was a pain to do and I don't relish having to move it off of there when the time comes.

&gt; Actually, a lot of pedophiles do NOT seek therapy because of the stigma. They fear (legitimately) being reported for their feelings even though they have not touched a child and want to do everything they can to never touch a child. newlinechar &gt; Removing the stigma for getting help would be beneficial. And before say that therapists would never turn in someone just for thoughts, you‚Äôd be wrong. newlinechar  newlinechar I referenced this already. If there's an issue with therapists reporting clients for pedophilia, then that's a reason for working to improve confidentiality in therapy sessions. But that doesn't mean we should remove the stigma from society at large. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; And removing the stigma for getting help does NOT mean that you are removing the stigma for child molestation and sexual assault. newlinechar  newlinechar I am not conflating removing the stigma against pedophilic desires with removing the stigma against pedophilic actions. I'm saying removing the stigma against pedophilic desires will make it socially acceptable and thus more common. If pedophilic desires is more common, then pedophilic acts be more common as well. Of course, this is making the assumption that if there are more people with a desire to do X, then more people will do X (which seems to be a valid assumption to me). newlinechar  newlinechar Additionally, it seems dubious that societal mores are sophisticated enough to differentiate between 'desires to do X' and 'actually doing X', but that's a different argument which I'm not making.
If that‚Äôs so, there‚Äôs always room for making new happy moments. Certain movies or music make you happy?

If you only look negative you will only see negative.

&gt;her dress is more of a combination of male and female clothes newlinechar  newlinechar The skirt with frills on her armour is a dead giveaway imo.

And really the first thing that I think would come to anyone's mind when they see her appear for the first time before Shirou is 'That's a girl'. I can agree with the training clothes and suit. But she didn't come with those. Nor did she wear them at her final battle. newlinechar  newlinechar I mean I'm not saying that I can't suspend my disbelief. It doesn't even bother me much of the time.

Her ability to make sp healing items without wasting the night (making 1 day palace trips easier) and *especially* being able to call her for massages that'll let you still have time at night even after going to a palace or Mementos that day. I'm not confused because you didn't know their was a time limit on her, I'm confused because if your goal was to get all the Confidants in one run, Kawakami's abilities are extremely helpful in that regard, so putting her off is... odd.

I had this issue earlier this year. newlinechar  newlinechar Their legally allowed to raise the rent, however they're obligated to do it legally and by the book.  newlinechar &amp;nbsp; newlinechar  newlinechar They must... more or less in this order: newlinechar  newlinechar - Provide a proper LTB form N1 newlinechar - The rental increase will take place in 90 days  newlinechar - This increase must not supersede the guideline for the year which will be 1.8% as of 2018 newlinechar - They are not allowed to increase the rent for another 12 months from when the new rate is issued. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar If they have not met any of the above criteria they are breaking the law and you are not obligated to pay, it's a bylaw but it's still a LAW.  newlinechar  newlinechar DO NOT PAY THE INCREASE ONLY WHAT YOU ORIGINALLY AGREED TO IF THEY DID NOT DO ANY OF THE ABOVE. By paying the rental increased rate you end up surrendering any of the above mentioned procedures and will forfeit any protection and rights you had originally. So no buyers remorse. It's like a new contract. newlinechar  newlinechar &amp;nbsp; newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Mine tried to pull this shit earlier this year citing they are needing to re-coop losses for something they caused, but are blaming me for despite their illegal mulit-unit dwelling w/o a permit. They tried to raise my rent by 4% and slipped a written note under my door the day before the end of the month. They seem to see me as docile and obedient and that I'd be easily inferred into waiving all my protection. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I wrote a note attached to my original rent amount w/ cheque saying, 'I apologize if I gave the impression that I had a significant increase in income. In reality the jobs are part time, rare, and usually only fixed contracts. I'm a reasonable person and more than willing to speak to you in regards to this however it is my understanding I am to be give a proper N1 form from the LTB, there has to also be 90 days before it takes effect, and furthermore I believe this is a 4% increase which is well above the stated guidelines of 1.5% for 2017 and 1.8% 2018. I believe this was an unintentional oversight, but attached is my cheque for (old rent price). I have lived here for many years and you know well I don't cause problems and I always pay for my own small maintenance in my unit.' newlinechar  newlinechar Haven't seen or heard anything from them since and I've kept my old rate. The fact that they thought I was weak and would be easily inferred is what irked me the most. In the end I won and the feeling of putting them in their place for thinking so low of me puts a smile on my face.

If anything ellison's the idiot for offering such a cushy job to someone with no background/credentials, so the critique should be with his decisionmaking and how unlikely it is someone in his position would realistically make that kind of offer (or give karen so much leeway at work). newlinechar  newlinechar If I had been working in a dead-end position with a salary paid for in snacks, and some bozo offered me a decent-paying job at a reputable company w/ benefits and a nice office (despite my lack of professional history and not even having applied) would I take it? fuck yeah I would.  newlinechar  newlinechar Karen accepting the position is the least unbelievable thing about it.

You are misunderstanding what I‚Äôm saying, my man. The suggestion of a causal relationship is literally in the introduction to the text: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;as evidence of crime-reducing RTC laws, now consistently generate estimates showing RTC laws **increase** overall violent crime and/or murder newlinechar  newlinechar Saying one thing *increases* another is a textbook ‚Äúcausal relationship‚Äù statement - one causes or affects the other. These conclusions cannot be drawn unless you perform an experiment, which you obviously cannot do in this scenario. newlinechar  newlinechar This issue permeates both sides of the argument. Unfortunately with things like this, you can never prove causation, and correlation can be deceptive. newlinechar  newlinechar For example, I‚Äôll admit a counterpoint to my own argument - I say that CCW ownership correlates negatively to crime, but that doesn‚Äôt mean CCW ownership is the *cause* of lower crime. It could be an underlying effect that moves both measures - like maybe higher income areas have less crime and also more people who can afford a gun. newlinechar  newlinechar I‚Äôm just trying to help you understand this, it‚Äôs a very misunderstood concept in statistics. Many think that if you find correlation and a causal relationship seems reasonable, that you can assume you‚Äôve found causation - but it can‚Äôt be proven and therefore a study claiming to find such a conclusion is bunk.

I can see where he gets that line of thought - companies raise prices whenever they think they can get more money.

Without greed, the only thing driving prices up would be the need to meet costs. If an equilibrium is met where all costs are covered, prices would stagnate.

At the federal level, we elect a President every 4 years and a Congress (all of the House and 1/3-2/3 of the Senate) every 2 years. The elections in which there is not a Presidential election are referred to as the midterm elections, because they are in the middle of the President's term. In order for a bill to become law in the US, both chambers of Congress need to pass it and then the President signs it.  newlinechar  newlinechar Currently, Republicans control both chambers of Congress and the White House. Effectively, they can do anything they want.  newlinechar  newlinechar The midterms could hurt Trump because if the Democrats take back one or both of the House or Senate, they can halt the legislative agenda of Trump and the Republicans.

For people you see frequently, sure. Strangers, not so much. For some women it's not a problem to go without and still look close enough to our society's beauty obsessed standard that they don't get looked at askance. Some of us are far enough from that visual expectation that the disparity itself causes some people to question us. newlinechar  newlinechar I _started_ wearing makeup in my 20s just to skip past the constant 'Are you okay/sick?', ' Did you get enough sleep?/You look tired.', 'Did you get in a fight?/Did somebody hurt you?', 'Are you on drugs?' (what kind of asshole adult seriously asks an eight year old that question?! Still salty about that one...), or the not an isolated occasion of 'What's wrong with your face?'. All of that from complete strangers; if they chose to say something at all rather than just give me the stink eye or pull their children/purses closer and scurry by avoiding eye contact. newlinechar  newlinechar There's nothing 'wrong' with my face, it's genetic. I'm of a people with pale to olive skin, and thin skin surrounding big, beautiful eyes (or so I've often been told) with lots of blood flow close to the surface of that thin skin. I'm not deformed or asymmetrical,  I don't have bad skin, and I'm perfectly healthy. But apparently I must look like a drug addicted, sleep deprived, domestically abused lowlife when I go without makeup. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't wear a lot of makeup, just some concealer under the eyes to lighten the skin, some skin colored foundation to blend it all in, and a little eyeliner and mascara that match my natural lash color. I have a 5 minute routine, no crazy colors, nothing caked on. Most people just assume it's 'natural'. What blew me away was how much _better_ strangers treated me, how open, respectful, and friendlier people were after I started wearing just a minimal amount of makeup! Store clerks were actually nice and helpful while strangers were comfortable enough to engage in pleasant conversation. The difference was _so_ stark that I kept at it. There's now no way I would go without in a professional setting, but I may occasionally run to the store without any and certainly don't wear any at home or just visiting family. newlinechar  newlinechar My reasoning is that it puts _other_ people at ease and allows them to skip past judgement about my appearance so we can interact as humans on equal ground. Those that like to spout the 'If you went without, nobody would care' line are generally people who have never _been_ in a position where people care. Please consider that some of us have had experiences that are well outside of your norm. newlinechar  newlinechar *To answer those that may ask, I've _never_ had any problems romantically as it relates to this, even after the makeup comes off (it's not a significant alteration, and the dark circles are still visible with makeup on, just less pronounced. I'm not 'tricking' men as some incels or red pillers like to imply. God, I can't believe I even have to add that caveat. Too much time spent on Reddit...).

&gt; If we're judging the quality of work we should strive to think beyond simply the most popular views. newlinechar  newlinechar Sure, I can agree. So how about hypothetically we would gather up all of the *top film critics of the world* - like the best of the best - and people who dedicate their lives to the craft of filmmaking; do you think that they would (as a majority) agree the prequels are superior?

Maybe local county governments need to rethink minimum size requirements for structures on rural properties, and allow people to live there full-time in RVs, at least in winter.  Even out in the country you can't just put anything anywhere.   A cheap structure like [this](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/86/af/5c/86af5c9be4ad2613a3df21aabb6a5361.jpg) would be ideal for an RVer taking a break from the road.

I'm losing -25% of my BTC holding ($14,000 now) to buy VET. newlinechar * The conservative side of me thinks to leave BTC alone, but I'm feeling FOMO for VET.  By the time BTC recovers, VET may have made much more returns.  And I may regret not doing it. **my original VET holding already made +100% return** newlinechar * I have more fiat to invest from Coinbase by January 6.  But I just think I can't wait that long.  Who knows how much VET may grow in a week. newlinechar  newlinechar What do you think guys?   newlinechar  newlinechar 1. Should I dump BTC for VET at a 25% loss tonight? newlinechar 2. Leave BTC alone and buy VET with more fiat full 6 days from today? (Saturday)

I haven't thought about using filters to keep from seeing spoilers. But really only Star Wars and Star Trek are the only movies that I care about going in oblivious to any major plot points or character surprises.

Maybe but he doesn't really slut shame others and just says these are his personal feelings/opinions. He does seem like a late bloomer socially but he's attractive, tall and very fit so I find it hard to believe that his lack of sexual experiences didn't have a lot to do with his person beliefs. His best college friend likes to share the story of a very attractive girl in their friend group who was obsessed with James to the point where she would wait in his bedroom during house parties in order to hook up with him and he'd hide until she left. His friend refers to this as 'typical James'. He admits she was very attractive but he just 'wasn't about that life'.

Most of what you wrote is what I've written in the past about my life as well; other than having dated which wasn't a thing for me. Though, I've certainly had less hospital visits on my side but a lot of holding ice packs and gauze after people repeatedly beat me for being too much of a girl despite not even knowing trans was even a thing. newlinechar  newlinechar My life has always been a blur and still is, and I've never had any form of stable employment due to a mix of conservative area (ie: transphobia) and health issues (physical and mental). As such, I'm pretty well fucked for later in life. Do you happen to have any of the dissociation 'disorders' (such as DID)?

However, I really do disagree you're a waste of a life. To me it sounds like you've been doing your best to cope with your situation.

A 3rd party has no chance at a higher office because they don't have the money and corporate donors.

Flair Up?
Eh. Not really. newlinechar  newlinechar Of course, this is might be due to coming into the series later than some, where a lot of these gender flips where much more common and having kings, Lords, and mythical figures being girls weren't out of the norm. If I came into the series earlier where Saber was one of the very FEW examples of this (such as before Grand Order went crazy with the idea), then my feelings would be different. newlinechar  newlinechar Still, as it is with the crazy things in this franchise I've kinda accepted it and it really doesn't bother me TOO much given that besides the...obvious things, doesn't change too much for me personally. I mean, if she was a different figure with a different backstory...eh, I dunno, wouldn't feel like Saber to me.  newlinechar  newlinechar We already have a standard version of Arthur (even if the stuff around him is limited due to his material), but I dunno, I like how her backstory works with her. Its weird, head turning, and insane...yeah, but given some of the other characters in the franchise, many who have nothing to do with the genderflipping? Doesn't bother me too much.  newlinechar  newlinechar Of course, on the topic of all that genderbending in FGO...yeah, sometimes they go a bit wacky with the concept. I don't think they overdue it...TOO much, but yeah, they took the concept and ran with it (which I think is fine given the game its from. They gotta continue to make new characters. Hell, for all we know eventually they could release versions of characters with their correct genders, like how they added in Proto-Arthur later on).
Why? Because that woman is displaying signs that she should be first?

&gt; Your 'subsidies' all account for 'social cost' subsidies eg healthcare problems related to fossil fuel use, which are not subsidies in the traditional sense but a modification of it to suit the argument. newlinechar  newlinechar An external cost is still a cost in fact, and when imposed on society it represents a subsidy.  You can't just pretend that the cost of fossil fuels exists in a vacuum - *that* is playing make-believe to suit the argument. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; And notably, the social cost of many renewables (specifically rare earth metals needed for their construction) is ignored because it happens in rural China which nobody cares about. newlinechar  newlinechar Utterly trivial dollar-for-dollar compared to fossil fuels.  FF's pollute in the process of exploration and extraction, pollute in the process of refinement, pollute in the process of transportation, and pollute in the process of usage.   newlinechar  newlinechar That's reduced to mining and recycling with renewables, and recycling would be incentivized all the more if mining is lucrative, so really just mining.  Once the materials for it are out of the ground, they will serve the world with minimal externality for generations. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; This is not an argument against renewables in general, but they are not cost-competitive. newlinechar  newlinechar They are in a growing number of places, and the costs are declining exponentially. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; If consumers cared about air quality first and foremost all cars would already be electric newlinechar  newlinechar I didn't say 'first and foremost', but we do care.  If we didn't, we wouldn't vote for subsidies, and we wouldn't buy the resulting products at all since even with subsidies they cost more in most markets because of FF subsidies. newlinechar  newlinechar Moreover, you're ignoring all the ways the automotive industry went out of its way to prevent consumers even having the option, and the billions it has spent on propaganda trying to brainwash them against science.  That's not the behavior of an industry that believes people would freely choose their products over alternatives. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; This is a perfectly acceptable situation, since fossil fuels would destroy all it's competition if the subsidies were removed. newlinechar  newlinechar Correction: Fossil fuel cartels would engage in anti-competitive behavior to destroy renewable energy without subsidies, exactly as they have done for decades and are still desperately trying to do with ever-decreasing effectiveness.

We apparently did not watch the same film.  Star Wars TLJ was terrible as a Star Wars film, and simply as a film itself.  The film was loaded with ridiculous plot holes, pointless subplots, poorly and awkwardly fleshed out characters, horrendous forced humor, cheap unnecessary levity, lacked wit, and overall was corny and stupid.  It was one of the most unsophisticated films I've ever seen in my entire life.  It had only a few redeeming moments and they were severely outweighed by the vast majority of the film's mediocrity.

You can NOT compare a Nissan Leaf's or a Renault Zoe's capabilities to those of a truck or SUV. Not even close. Also I'm guessing you're european so you have little experience with fullsize trucks. If they're being used for working and carrying things like intended, they're extremely good at what they do. /u/greyhoundpie has completely valid reasons for wanting a truck for work and a fullsize SUV for home use. They just work, and you can't get any other sort of vehicle to my knowlege short of an SUV or truck with 4WD. It is important to note here that 4WD != AWD.

The thing is we aren't going to recruit anyone with a report or a complicated analysis of the economy. While those things are very important, they don't get many people on our side, especially those of the working class. We need to organize and really help and prove that we are for them. We do need the an analysis of the economy when it comes to planning strategically, but if we don't fix things like the things we wear, our branding, etc. we won't be able to appeal to the masses. Similar to how the Bolsheviks implemented a proto-mass line tactic with phrases such as 'Peace, bread, and land.' We have to work with symbolism in order to appeal to actual human beings. Human beings are flawed, and a huge report on the economy won't cause them to change their opinions until we show them we are for them.

Since Heavy is best played on defense (or in a passive manner in general), he should only be unspun when the movespeed is absolutely necessary. This usually applies to retreating.

 newlinechar Life seen by atheism newlinechar  newlinechar I am talking here about true atheism and the true atheist, and not people who sway between faith and atheism: he is atheist one day and believers in another day or atheist for certain things or ideas and believing for others newlinechar Atheism has a philosophy of life against human nature. newlinechar Yes Atheism, is against the innate aspiration of Man. By nature, man wants to live long or even eternally, so to be eternal, aspires to permanent happiness, he aspires to justice and if one day he suffered an injustice, he would like this injustice to be repaired, newlinechar  newlinechar That's innate, atheism is against all that. newlinechar  newlinechar For the first aspiration, to be eternal, atheism says that man is a mass of matter that is used even before, he dies and life is finished for him, thus destroys this aspiration of being eternal, and reduces life to a few years or at worst a hundred years and then it is turned into dust. newlinechar Faith respects this aspiration by believing that there is a life after death, an eternal life newlinechar For the first aspiration: in atheism, either you are lucky, and you are in a situation of happiness, and you benefit from it, or you have missed this opportunity and you will live in misfortune and you will die in the woe, and too bad for you, newlinechar Faith allows the believer, even if he passes a bad life, to catch himself in the hereafter and already this feeling creates him an extraordinary happiness, while the atheist lives with the idea that death destroys all newlinechar  newlinechar . newlinechar Man by nature is ambitious, wants eternity, wants eternal pleasure. newlinechar He also wants that if he has suffered an injustice, that he can come to justice and have reparations for damages. newlinechar Atheism, by reducing man to a ball of matter, which is doomed to extinction, or to an animal that makes his life and then disappears, atheism by this philosophy of life removes from man this aspiration to eternity, justice, happiness to see its injustice repaired newlinechar For atheism: newlinechar The serial rapist and his victims have the same outcome: decomposition and then become of the earth. The victims have no right to aspire to justice. newlinechar Parents who have lost a young child, have no chance to see him again, while the man still aspires to see his children again, it is innate newlinechar  newlinechar With Atheism, life is sad (it gives a false joy), and I think now of a word of an atheist man, at the bedside of his moribund mother, he looked at me then he said: you are lucky, you are believers. newlinechar I understand this sentence better for him, unlike the believer 'he will not see his mother anymore' newlinechar  newlinechar And if life is only uterus sending people and the earth makes them disappear (and now incineration), that it is the value of good and evil. newlinechar What is the value of good and evil if the man's point of view atheism, his goal does not exceed the purpose of an animal, besides as an atheist once told me 'after all the man is an animal ¬ª newlinechar What is the purpose of the appearance of the universe, why life, death? Why crush a man on the road will be more serious than crushing a deer newlinechar Why, according to the principle of natural selection, we do not kill the mentally handicapped, the senile, the dements. newlinechar Besides, even the woman according to darwin is only a '... a constant companion (a friend for the old age) who will be interested in you, an object to cherish and with whom to play - better than a dog - a home and someone to take care of the house ... '(Darwin, 1958: 232,233). newlinechar The believer has another philosophy of life on earth, which answers his questions, which also responds to his aspiration as a man (desire for happiness, desire for eternity, desire for justice, desire to see his dear loved ones again. .etc). he knows that life on earth is ephemeral, and therefore impossible for him to fulfill all his desires, especially since it does not only depend on him, many other factors may prevent him from realizing his aspirations, his desires during his life, but he can realize them in the beyond and it's up to him, no other factor. newlinechar Allah says 'and the life of the hereafter is better and eternal' newlinechar And the prophet saws, 'The life of the believer is astonishing: if he has good' What the business of the believer is amazing! newlinechar His business involves (for him) only good: newlinechar If he is the object of a happy event, he thanks Allah and this is a good thing for him. newlinechar If he is the victim of a misfortune, he endures it with patience and that is a good thing for him, and this belongs only to the believer '. newlinechar The verse and hadith allow believers to enjoy life on earth and not fall into disarray or depression. newlinechar If he has good, thank God and think of others, and if an evil touches him even serious, he endures and knows that this is ephemeral, given what he expects in reward for this patience.

I can see what you mean to an extent, but I would argue that those changes/differences are very minor in the grand scheme of things. The combat in SH was never a strong suit, always clunky... they tried to advance it a bit here but, perhaps ironically, the end result was largely similar, and didn't alter the core 'gameplay loop' that much.   newlinechar  newlinechar And you do traverse a town often enough. Maybe not to the same high amount of past games, but you definitely have to plenty of times, to reach various locations. And while traversing those locations - whatever they may be, town or not - it still 'feels' very much like an SH game in most ways. I'd say that's kind of a nitpick.   newlinechar  newlinechar (do you even traverse the town all that much in SH3? I honestly can't remember doing so much... certainly do in 1 &amp; 2... but I could be mistaken)   newlinechar  newlinechar Obviously there are going to be some alterations made from game to game, to try to advance things or keep things fresh etc., and Homecoming definitely has some differences to a degree, but it's by and large like at least 80% the same as other Silent Hill games IMO. To say it doesn't feel like a SH game seems hyperbolic to me. Now, if it's a LORE thing people think makes it feel way different, that's a whole other ballgame... one I'd be interested in hearing about actually because I'm definitely rusty on my 'SH Universe' details lol. (though in my ignorance right now I'd probably still argue that the vast majority of it remains similar)

I agree spy needs a buff but he is not meant to be a mobile class. He is worse than sniper in 6v6 yes but spy does have a key advantage, surprise. Yes you can sneak into a spot as sniper but you are much more likely to be seen entering a sight line and called out. As spy you can sneak up behind the medic or demo and kill them. There is also the fact that a well played spy usually guarantees one pick. Yes he then dies afterwards making it a 5v5 but the sniper essentially does the same thing as a sniper doesn‚Äôt count as much in a team fight (Yes I know he could go off and get a bunch of kills but that‚Äôs not as likely). It is hard to give the spy a buff because giving him speed is very dangerous. It would have to have a serious penalty like not being in combat for a couple of seconds or at full health so it couldn‚Äôt be abused in a dead ringer style fashion. Believe me I would love for spy to get buffed enough to get used frequently but he is probably the trickiest class to get right especially since the spy isn‚Äôt supposed to be mobile or have high survivability.

&gt; This shit could very well be a secular protest newlinechar  newlinechar 38 years ago, Iran was one of the most 'westernized' nations in the region.

I would not accept money from others until you are very confident in the business.  Have you run the algo yet? 'I'm fairly confident my algorithm works' is not a very strong indication that it's been running long.  Give it maybe 6 months to a year and re-assess.  Don't get greedy.  Friends money will cause stress to yourself and damage relationships.  It doesn't matter what is on paper or how strong you think you are, this stuff is always stressful and mentally challenges everyone who tries. newlinechar  newlinechar As for tracking your trades - I don't have specific US advice - but be prepared for an audit where you must produce this information.  It is not difficult really - throw every trade in a database somewhere that is securely encrypted / backed up.  I presently have systems that do ~500,000 'trades' a week and have worked at places that will do up to that much *per day*.  Storage and tracking them has never been an issue so you should be fine with this requirement. newlinechar  newlinechar For reporting you will likely be required to produce a general summary (e.g., turned over $X for $Y profit) maybe slightly broken down, but then the detail is usually only wanted for auditing.  Which may happen a lot given the new world of crypto.  But regardless if you can't produce it you are in a world of hurt - even for yourself - as being able to produce a nice PNL report each day (e.g., I made 0.5 BTC / $8k today) is probably one of the first things you will want.  Especially if you are taking investment - prepare for a comprehensive reporting system that needs to do this anyway. newlinechar  newlinechar Good luck!

Fallen Enchantress newlinechar  newlinechar I recommend The Man in the High Castle by Philip K. Dick. It's an alternate history novel about people living in the US under Japanese and German rule after the allies lost WWII. It tells the story through multiple perspectives, including a Japanese official, a Jew hiding from the Germans, and an American antique shop owner. There's also an alternate fiction book inside the story about a world where the allies won. Philip K. Dick's books are all really mindfucky and often deal with stuff like scifi and drug use, but this is one of his tamer stories, but also one of the best. The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch by him is also great if you want a mindfuck. I don't even know where to begin to describe the story of that, so you'd have to look it up yourself if you're interested.

Exactly. newlinechar  newlinechar I've watched anime quite a lot, and I've avoided Naruto like the plague for just about most of my life. Seemed childish and stupid to me. Having picked it up however, I was incredibly intrigued at what I had dismissed for pretty much no reason.  newlinechar  newlinechar Naruto is quite deep, and incredibly artistic. It is culture heavy, using and appreciating both legends, folklore, religion and interesting concepts all around. The themes it plays with, dualism, war, suffering, they are all addressed properly.  newlinechar  newlinechar The series is quite compact also. For a series with so many episodes, Naruto can be summed up pretty fast. Another thing that surprised me about it, was the art style. As someone who loves art in pretty much every way possible, Naruto stood out. The designs are often clean, simple and very satisfying.  newlinechar  newlinechar Lastly, Naruto felt surprisingly grounded for what it was. Now, granted, it took off during the end, but it did it nicely. Naruto has a very logical foundation for Chakra, and where its from, and how it can be used, and it all felt logical and reasonable. Besides that, things like the giant Tailed Beast, and the legends of the past--Naruto really felt like another world. And surprisingly, we only explored the Shinobi parts of it. The hidden villages, essentially military bases. Its a vast world, and Kishimoto did a WONDERFUL job.  newlinechar  newlinechar

According to the CMHC ([source](http://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/foreign-investment-in-toronto-vancouver-housing-below-5-pct)), in Vancouver foreign investors (of all nationalities) own 4.8% of residential properties. The problem in Vancouver is not that foreigners own property, it's that people (including Canadians) started flipping properties quickly. Blaming it on the Chinese is just racism and serves to only deflect the problem. newlinechar  newlinechar Want to stop the exponential property growth in places like Vancouver &amp; Toronto? Put some restrictions on property flipping. I'd propose that we put a tax on the profits from selling a house if you have lived in it for less than 5 years... let's say 80% if you lived there less than a year, 60% if it's less than 2 years, 40% if it's less than 3 years, 20% if it's less than 4 years, 10% if it's less than 5 years. newlinechar  newlinechar Suddenly flipping becomes much less profitable unless your willing to sit on the property for years (which ties up capital and requires a much higher return on investment).

Currently poor med student, we have the house set to 60 degrees.  I leave the oven door open after I've baked something and hang out there for awhile.
Thankfully, however, none of the above is true. One reason I *like* Inigo is because he's **not** slutty waifu # 87641097641. Instead, he's a wonderful male companion, of which there are far too few. If you want an interactive female companion who has a generally raunchy personality, might I suggest Sofia? Guys with your interests are well-catered to at Nexus, you aren't wanting for pornographic pixels.

They look trained and well armed, which indicates they have received outside help or they are straight up mercenaries.  The USA often covertly trains rebel groups to achieve political goals.  We helped the mujahideen  beat the Russians that way (which led to Al Qaeda and the blowback of 9/11).  We have been funding dozens of groups in the Middle East, so saying its the USA is a reasonable guess.

During Passover it is eaten as a flat, cracker-like bread or used in dishes as breadcrumbs and in the traditional matzo ball soup. newlinechar  newlinechar Matzo that is kosher for Passover is limited in Ashkenazi tradition to plain matzo made from flour and water. newlinechar  newlinechar *** newlinechar  newlinechar ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/BreadStapledToTrees/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^] newlinechar ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
It would still be a silly system. Someone would have to come up with a better slogan to get more clicks than the rival ads ('click here to get 20% off **and be cool**'). If they're particularly good at it (i.e. better than me), they would demand money for it. The only ones who would pay them are companies. Companies still get money from consumers. So consumers would still pay artists (who probably hate their jobs) to make them buy stuff they don't need. newlinechar  newlinechar If you care about ads it's because your employer would go bankrupt without them, or because your favorite content producers would have to go work in a callcenter and stop produce the content you like. Nobody *inherently* cares about ads. Nobody goes 'Oooh! There's the new floobnark ad! I've been waiting to get a new floobnark for months!' You just go and get a floobnark when you need one.

Mages in the TM world are very secretive about their research, so all mage families have some knowledge to some extend that nobody else has, the three families all just specialised in three different branches of magic that were needed for the Holy Grail war.

I value your opinion since i'm willing to bet you've watched more browns than i have, but I sincerely disagree. He's consistently dropping safeties so far back that the defense is essentially playing a man down (or two). There's absolutely no defense to playing Brett Hundley like [this](https://i.imgur.com/rRoBrlF.jpg). An offense led by Landry Jones and Fitz Toussaint did whatever they wanted to his defense today. A defense with a front 7 as talented as the Browns have should have been much better than they were this year.

&gt; With clothes most of th ereally expensive ones are objectively no better, fashion is mostly subjective newlinechar  newlinechar So what is your point. That because it isn't objective it is stupid? What is for sure if you buy expensive clothing is that more thought has been put into it (usually, of course you can get a white tee with a box logo, but that's beside the point since 'no one' buys those) and thus it has a better design most of the time. It's like a sports car. It might be subjective if a sports car looks cooler than a normal car, but you can be sure that a lot more thought went into it than a normal car. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; you arent paying for quality you are paying to look cool. newlinechar  newlinechar Well, both. Bad quality looks bad so it's connected. I mean not to be a douche, but I assume you have never owned an expensive piece of clothing.

It's not arbitrarily drawn. It's 180 degrees longitude, and even though it deviates from that in a few places, 180 degrees was specifically selected for because it doesn't pass through any major countries/territories. Where is does deviate from 180long, its so it avoids specific territories. It's also in no way binding, there are no treaties establishing it, nor is there a prohibition to prevent countries from changing it for themselves.

OH MY GOSH. ive never seen it so small and i totally see what you mean. LMAO, IM SO EMBARRASSED.
You are correct in many ways. Thank you for the thoughtful response. newlinechar  newlinechar I agree that funding higher education needs to be a priority, the problem is that throwing more money at problems doesn't always fix them. I am more familiar with west coast Universities and I am troubled by the amenities war taking place on campus and RAPID replacement of local students with international ones. Throwing money is one way to solve this problem, one reason international students are increasingly popular is because they pay more in tuition allowing the university to subsidize local and disadvantaged students, but they take up those students places in the process and often take their skills (or degree without the skills) back to their home country. This is not good for America and I see no one willing to talk about except for a few. The college administration is bloated beyond belief and with ever increasing mandates to 'protect' (see: coddle) their students they are sure to grow.  newlinechar  newlinechar So in my opinion its not a lack of funds that higher ed is suffering from its lack of creativity and collaboration with industry. Of course it starts in local public schools which could undoubtably use more funding in most cases (not all). That is the money that should be spread around more, but it is a LOCAL problem not one for the federal government. Rich schools are using money frivolously that poorer communities desperately need especially in the places like CA and NY. newlinechar  newlinechar Also yes the GOP does have a shitty track record on the economy (looking at you Bush II), but at least Trump isn't very connected to the party of old. I have never liked Bush and find comfort in the fact that Trump hasn't either, also mentioned in a debate that 9/11 happened under Bush's watch which would have been the end of most republicans career.

&gt;Lets stop pretending. The Palestinians have increased terrorism using the settlements as an excuse. newlinechar  newlinechar I wasn't pretending. After Israel started the settlements terrorism became much more prominent. Maybe because it made palestinians more pissed off, maybe because it made it easier to kill jews. newlinechar  newlinechar Reguardless of the reasons, the facts are the same. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Not possible for Israel to steal land that belongs to it. newlinechar  newlinechar Lets quit pretendjng here, the land does not belong to Israel. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;...their government, schools, media, and religious figures have been telling them so for nearly a century. newlinechar  newlinechar Also grandpa Muhamed who regails his kids about Israel demolishing his entire city and ethnically cleansing them from the land. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Conversely, the Israelis are convinced that the Palestinians don't want peace because they have repeatedly rejected a two-state solution newlinechar  newlinechar I'm not convinced the palestinian governments are either. But maybe Israel should have offered the 67 borders instead of land swaps. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;and instead put in place a government whose goal is to destroy Israel. newlinechar  newlinechar Hamas won 1 seat... their in power because of a violent take over. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Seems to me that Israel makes a better case here for who doesn't want peace. The Palestinians could have peace at any time, simply by stopping the terrorism. newlinechar  newlinechar Yeah peace with the country stealing your land. newlinechar  newlinechar Palestinians argunent is 'we will stop killing yoir civillians when they stop invading' newlinechar  newlinechar Israeli's argument is 'we will stop moving our civillians onto your land when you stop killing them.' newlinechar  newlinechar Sounds like the Palestinians make a better argument.

I do agree that guaranteed damage on XCOM (any variant) is king, especially in early-game.

I don't think Lobo has any problems. The problem is Deathstroke getting constant power ups from characters that die and revive.

'How do you distinguish between deism and atheism?' newlinechar  newlinechar I see two answers. newlinechar  newlinechar 1. God is the basis for all that exists, and so the question is asking the difference between our current reality and sheer nothing (absence of any thing). In other words reality under the premise 'atheism is true' is impossible to conceive, once you have a proper definition of God (the self-sufficient act of being, existence itself, the source of all being). newlinechar  newlinechar 2. If we ignore all philosophy for the past 3,000 years, *then* the answer becomes 'I don't know.' However, you presumably meant to ask about theism, not deism, since this forum is to debate *Christians*, in which case I would say there would not be Christianity today; the Church would have failed nearly 2,000 years ago along with the movements of other failed Jewish messiahs or other cult followings today that don't last. We would not hear claims of miracles on the news,* because of course they don't report about things that have absolutely no basis in reality (please read that literally: 'fake news' is a different category, namely, lying about reality). I mean to say, for example, no one is publishing stories about Russell's teapot orbiting the sun, because of course there is no good reason to think it exists. newlinechar  newlinechar *see for examples http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/9709/10/teresa.first.slum/index.html?eref=sitesearch http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2299217.stm http://edition.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/europe/10/17/vatican.teresa/index.html http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1562284/Mother-Teresa-miracle-patient-accuses-nuns.html http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-35129463 http://edition.cnn.com/2015/12/18/europe/pope-francis-mother-teresa-second-miracle/index.html

In general, if it's not spamming, it should typically be okay. For example, if you make an OC brain-explosion meme like that, you post it, and it gets some upvotes, that's great. If somebody else sees that and says 'Man, I really like those memes, I should make one' and then submits his own version 2 hours later while the other is still on the front page, *that* would be removed. I don't have a concrete time interval for you in terms of what's okay vs. not-okay, but spinning off of an overused or popular meme is typically fine, as long as it's not overused *here* at that moment.

I don't know if a recording of Wayne June reading The Rats In The Walls exists, but it'd be awesome if it did. Wayne June is, by far, my favorite Lovecraft audiobook narrator. I first found out about him by playing Darkest Dungeon, then moved on to his Lovecraft audiobooks. I remember the first I heard was him reading The Horror At Red Hook, an overall not so great story but made much better by June's reading of it. newlinechar  newlinechar I recently bought an audiobook on Audible of nearly every story Lovecraft ever wrote and was extremely disappointed to see there wasn't a single one read by Wayne June in it. Every story is read by someone different, and they couldn't fit in a single Wayne June narration? I did hear a lot of other great narrators, but none quite did it for me like June does. The one thing that annoys me about it is they don't tell you who the narrator is, so all I can do is say I really like this guy, even though I have absolutely no idea who he is. They list everyone in the audiobook's description but don't say which story they read.

So by your statement, Weiss is a complete character already and therefore can be safely removed from the main story without any serious backlash to the story overall. newlinechar  newlinechar I will downvote you for the sole reason that you are completely narrowing your overall scope. Weiss still has to take back the name of the company that is rightfully hers, otherwise her inclusion into RWBY at all would be pointless. Yes the goodguys must suffer losses, we already found out with Pyrrha. Weiss found out the hard way that she cannot rely solely on her summons, which was necessary.

At regal you can get a free movie ticket for 15,000 points, free popcorn for 7000, free soda for 8000. You get 100 points per dollar. But if you frequently go there you get status bonus points which can be up to 1000 per visit. All this is absolutely free. So say I see a movie with the highest status. My ticket is 15.00  that's 1,500 points and then add 1000 bonus for status. That's 2,500 points so for every 6 movies I see I get a free movie ticket that I can use for 3D movies($3 fee on top of free pass) , imax(upcharge) , or for a friend to come with for free. Or I can have a popcorn and soda with those points. So I would be upset that I didn't get those points because they benefit me or my friends. I understand moviepass pays for the ticket. But the theaters are wrong not to give me those points. If anything I would be ok with moviepass getting those points in the form of shared revenue since they are covering the cost. But for theaters not to give points period is not okay.

Keep in mind a cost of a night out is very geography specific too. I'm in Chicago like I said and $30 for 2 gets you a step above fast food.

The quality is questionable, yes. But to say it is not punk is plain silly.
4 have have won posthumously. 
Heh. That's good advise, especially considering exactly what could easily been inferred from my comment. I didn't want to (or even think about) the thesis that would be required to list every factor, caveat, condition and exception to my comment. newlinechar  newlinechar But that being said, I'm no newbie to auto racing. As a matter of fact, I was taught to drive by my father, and ex formula vee racing driver. Pretty much all we talk about is driving theory. newlinechar  newlinechar Incidentally, tires were literally the FIRST thing I bought for the car. Previous tires were in good condition, but I know exactly how important tires are for a vehicle and put some nice rubber on the very next day. Bridgestone Potenza RE970AS Pole Positions, in case you care. I live in an area that never sees snow, but wet traction is important about 5 times a year, so All Season are acceptable. newlinechar  newlinechar Next 'upgrade' to the vehicle will be suspension bushings, tie rods, ball joints, wheel bearings and a differential brace. Primarily because I bought it as a project car, and the first thing to do is replace a lot of aging components. I've already replaced the entire cooling system, including the water pump. And I do all the work myself (my dad will help if I need it, and definitely give advice [considering he went form racing to working as a mechanic, then service manager for 30 years]), but he's retired now, so I wouldn't asking him to do any labor. newlinechar  newlinechar As for driving experience, well, my skills have atrophied over the years (due to not owning a vehicle for 10 years), but I'm quite familiar with the concepts of weight transfer. And I know enough to listen to what my car is telling me through the steering wheel. It let's me know what kind of footing it has if I just 'listen' to it. newlinechar  newlinechar All I was saying with my previous comment was when I first got her, I was surprised that I couldn't feel that warning anywhere near to where I was used; I expected her to start warning me about lateral forces WAY sooner than she actually did. I actually have to be careful, because instead of looking at the speedometer, I got so used to listening to the car for at what speed it could handle a corner that I'll go around. So used to doing this, in fact, that I'll take a few local corners fast enough that it actually triggers my 'speed sense' instead of my 'grip sense' (sort of like when your alarm doesn't go off in the morning: at a certain point your brain just feels that something is off because it's got to be later than when you alarm was set), and I'll look down at the speedo and realize I'm doing 80. There was no under steer what so ever doing this maneuver. newlinechar  newlinechar Friday night wasn't typical for me. I never aim to 'break her loose,' and the only reason I did was 1) I had the room to recover 2) I didn't push the barrier, just feathered close and 3) there is a rough patch on that road that reduces the contact patch.

&gt; I referenced this already. If there's an issue with therapists reporting clients for pedophilia, then that's a reason for working to improve confidentiality in therapy sessions. But that doesn't mean we should remove the stigma from society at large. newlinechar  newlinechar The reason therapists illegally go against confidentiality in these situations is because of the stigma. Therapists are human and many of them (even with their education) don‚Äôt think that there can be non-offending pedophiles. They report them out of fear and the idea of ‚Äúprotecting the children‚Äù when the person who sought therapy has never touched a child and sought therapy for the express purpose of never touching a child.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; I‚Äôm saying removing the stigma against pedophilia will make it socially acceptable and thus more common. If pedophilia is more common, then pedophilic acts  be more common as well. Of course, this is making the assumption that if there are more people with a desire to do X, then more people will do X (which seems to be a valid assumption to me). newlinechar  newlinechar And this is where we disagree. I don‚Äôt think otherwise non-pedophilic people are going to suddenly want to have sex with children if we remove the stigma. newlinechar  newlinechar The whole point is that stigma or no, these people exist. And we don‚Äôt know what causes them to have these feelings. Do you know why you are straight/gay/whatever? Do you remember the moment you decided to be that way? No. Because you didn‚Äôt decide. You just were. Just like no one is going to decide to be a pedophile just because we may remove the stigma for seeking treatment.  newlinechar  newlinechar Read *The Other Side Of Desire* by Daniel Bergner.

I'll stop there plot-wise to avoid spoilers for anyone who might read it in the future. The story was mostly told from the standpoint of a Professor in another state who was corresponding with the guy fighting off the aliens. I'm having trouble remembering character names though. I apparently can't remember names of anything today. It was pretty good and I liked it, though.

College football in a soccer-specific stadium would be awesome. The seats are much closer to the field, so the passionate fans would create a pretty cool atmosphere. newlinechar  newlinechar The only issue I could see is that some MLS pitches are smaller than others. The width shouldn't be an issue since soccer fields are wider. Football sideline/bench areas tend to be bigger, but there's probably enough room to handle that. The length could be an issue though. Orlando City's pitch is 120 yards long, the same size as a football field, but there's very little buffer space between the touchline and the stands. It could get a little tight for the people working on the sidelines (photographers, TV crews, ball boys, etc.)

The unjustified killings are just the most blatant symptom of a larger disease. They are dramatic evidence of systemic racism in the police and judicial symptoms.

At least for my part, I tend to vote without respect to the kinks presented- I figure that with some of the weirder stuff that I might not be into personally, DPP is their only outlet for it, and a lot of the times I upvote prompts, M4F especially, that I might not like the kinks of, but still think are well done. newlinechar  newlinechar But I do downvote, although at least in my case, it's in the following circumstances: newlinechar  newlinechar - When the prompt is clearly soliciting more content than they provide the reader - if you wax enthusiastic about wanting a handsome, literate roleplayer for detailed shenanigans but provide nothing more than cookie-cutter description of your (alleged) physical appearance, Mr. Blue Arrow gets a visit. It does seem a bit more common for F4X prompts to do this, but not entirely. newlinechar - Being an asshole in one's out-of-character talk in a prompt. In-character is fine; some people like cocky assholes. But if someone comes off as rude or entitled... Yup, another visit.  newlinechar - Frequent reposting of near-identical content - if someone posts the same damn thing every day, with  just enough variation to avoid the mods, it still doesn't mean that person's really contributing to the sub. This one's an equal-opportunity offense, in my past observation. newlinechar - Stuff I consider inherently just... wrong. This one is a *high, high,* ***high*** bar to clear. This stuff is fantasy, I get it - if you want to get all non-con on your fantasy family members, or have every orifice stuffed by a pack of wild dogs, or pull some *Black Mirror*-type sci-fi shit, that's great! Live and let live. But if you're soliciting someone to play out your *real life*, mentally disabled neighbor for a vicious rape fantasy (which I've actually seen)? Yeah, that's a no. That's a *hard* no, and you're getting a downvote.   newlinechar - If it's stolen from someone else, I'll smack that button before reporting, just out of a sense of righteous justice. newlinechar - If it's lazily written. Not poorly written - we have a substantial user base that may not have English as their first language, and varying levels of skill, and they deserve to have fun just like everyone else. But if someone's just phoning it in, and clearly trading on demographic appeal, or writing just enough with 'pics in post history?' Also a downvote. newlinechar  newlinechar That's pretty much the bulk of my downvotes, honestly- if I just dislike a prompt/it's another M4F/it seems weird, I'm more likely to upvote it. I read pretty much everything that catches my eye regardless of gender tag, honestly, and try to spread some love where I can.  newlinechar  newlinechar So that's just my take on, I guess, how I see downvoting here and what some 'acceptable' reasons for doing it are.

&gt; Puerto Rican‚Äôs already have that? newlinechar  newlinechar Not entirely? They have some of the package but nowhere close to as much as an actual American citizen. Their infrastructure is nowhere even close to what we have. They have it better than others for sure but that's it.  newlinechar &gt;PR is already a US territory not some random island in the ocean, lots of states have debt. newlinechar  newlinechar That means nothing. They are not the US. We do not need their debt. That's not a reason to take their debt on.  There has to be some benefit to the United States. Why do we need to expand our borders? Just because someone asked us? We're not obligated to expand nor are we moving to the whims of manifest destiny anymore. I'd have to see a compelling reason to take PR as a state before I move my opinion on this.

Honestly, people might sometimes be a little bit too sensitive, but you people who are too far on the opposite are equally as annoying. People aren't unreasonable because they react negatively to something you think is funny, and if you wanna complain about 'thought policing' you should make an effort to not police people's emotions, because that is equally as bad. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, comedians aren't above criticism, I love Dave Chappelle, but people must be allowed to speak their mind about his content without you yelling over them. Like how are you any different if you're actively trying to silence other people and dismiss their perspective as wrong because they don't agree with you on something? newlinechar  newlinechar So if you want to act superior about this, then you should on occasion have conversations with people who are more sensitive about these topics than you without just dismissing everything they say without giving it a second thought, if you can't do that you are no different than they are.

The biggest problem I had was the lack of detail in Aqours practicing and how they came up with the material.

I'm not sure if there is any truth to something happening to his face, but it's an interesting statement for two reasons. If he was a young offender, it could possibly be acne or something to that effect. Then again, if the 'strange' people that were seen in the neighborhood prior to the attack is actually the East Area Rapist, he didn't seem to have any distinguishing features. Secondly, I find that response by him fascinating because of how quick-witted he was. He made that comment rather quickly and he more than likely wasn't ever expecting someone to say that, especially during a rape, so how he managed to come up with that response so fast is interesting to me.

&gt;An external cost is still a cost in fact, and when imposed on society it represents a subsidy. You can't just pretend that the cost of fossil fuels exists in a vacuum - that is playing make-believe to suit the argument. newlinechar  newlinechar ok, in that case renewables loose hard because the materials for them are strip mined in China, which does incredible amounts of damage to the local environment.

Why can nonhuman animals be exploited because they don‚Äôt have ‚Äòadvanced language‚Äô?What‚Äôs inherent to advanced language that those that lack should not have the right to their own life? newlinechar  newlinechar Why can nonhuman animals be exploited because they don‚Äôt have ‚Äòmorality‚Äô? They aren‚Äôt moral agents but they are moral patients. I see no clear connection between an animal‚Äôs lack of capacity for morals and their right to not be exploited. Can you explain further? newlinechar  newlinechar Animals can reason, have emotions, can problem solve, are intelligent, and some of them can even use tools. None of these are unique to humans. They‚Äôre not even applicable to ALL humans. Many humans cannot use language, problem solve, or be said to have much intelligence, so it‚Äôs very unconvincing to base our argument around these characteristics. newlinechar  newlinechar No one is saying that animals and humans need to be treated exactly the same - that‚Äôs an absurd inference. The question at hand is not asking about whether animals need to be treated in exactly the same way as humans. The question is whether nonhuman animals should have the right to not be exploited against their will. Very simple.  newlinechar  newlinechar There‚Äôs no boy or or dog drowning in an icy lake. There‚Äôs a healthy plant-based meal and a pig next to each other. Do you have the right to kill and eat the pig when you could eat the plant-based meal? If so, why? Do you have the right to kill that pig when you have other options and then turn around and say that no one can come harm you when they have other options? That is the question being asked.

Tens of thousands is way too long. I would say 4000 years maximum, considering that's the age of the oldest civilizations we still have concrete records and archaelogical artifacts on.

Correlation *never* equals causation.   newlinechar  newlinechar For example, just because the Sun always rises in the East and sets in the West every single day does not mean that this is what causes the phenomenon of the Sun moving across the sky.

Okay, so I've had this thought kicking around in my head for a while. Sirius Black is basically an alternate Draco Malfoy, more than anyone else in the series. newlinechar  newlinechar Similarities: newlinechar -From ancient pure blood families with old money newlinechar -Family supports Voldemort newlinechar -Meant to be the heir to family name and fortune newlinechar -Raised with the confidence and arrogance to support it newlinechar  newlinechar They diverge because Sirius, obviously, does not share the family pure-blood mania. The way he jokes about breaking the Slytherin tradition in his family when he was 11 leads me to believe that as a child, he didn't realize how crazy his family was. Draco Malfoy knows that his name carries weight and that he is sort of fulfilling his destiny, and so his confidence leads him to throw that around, to strut around the school. Sirius, however, feels the Black name differently - that it's sort of an albatross that he needs to refute. However, his confidence and arrogance still has the same source - from family grooming their next heir. As he grows to separate from his family, he doesn't just express Gryffindor pride, he needs to live and prove it - leading up to insulting and bullying Slytherins like Snape. newlinechar  newlinechar Sirius clearly has a huge chip on his shoulder because of his family background. It's natural that Snape hates Sirius the most because Sirius has everything Snape wants - the family name, pureblood status, wealth, likeability - and Sirius throws it away. On the other hand, Sirius can't understand why Snape, who didn't grow up with the same crazy family (and knowing nothing of Snape's actual childhood) and who has a muggleborn friend, would buy into the pureblood mania to begin with. Sirius had to prove he was different from Snape and people like Snape. James did not. newlinechar  newlinechar James, from what little we know of him, is more easy going because he doesn't have the same turmoil in his life that Sirius and Snape grew up with. His family doted on him, he didn't need or want for anything, he was smart and talented and popular. And, like a lot of teens who find themselves in this situation and who are living in particularly stressful times, he was an ass who could be, at best, inconsiderate of others' feelings and, at worst, an actual bully.  James can grow out of it without carrying the baggage around, but Sirius and Snape always did because their conflict ran a lot deeper than just Slytherin/Gryffindor rivalry.  newlinechar  newlinechar This was kind of all over the place, but that's basically the differences in interaction I gathered about those three. I wouldn't be surprised if an adult James would have found himself siding with Lupin a lot more over Sirius in terms of letting bygones be bygones and growing up.

I read a lot about how people are hungry in the US and I donate to food share amongst other charities. But is this mainly because parents don't know how to organize and or cook? Or don't have kitchens? Or drugs? (Please don't attack me I'm being serious). I grew up with parents earning $3/hour with no government assistance and we still had plenty to eat. Rice and beans and big bowls of noodles with a few ground meat in it is very filling and cost a few cents. At school, breakfast and lunches were free and even served them during summer vacations. Most of my friends had food stamps and also had plenty of food. newlinechar When my friend was going through a hard time, she went to the food bank and again never went hungry.  newlinechar My grandma's church had free meals pretty much every meal.  newlinechar What do we need to do to fill these gaps because there are certainly hungry people. 
I have to say - When us British people sing in our British accent and I think it usually sounds horrible. Lily Allen is a prime example. Singing in that horrible London-ish accent she got makes her singing sound terrible. Do you think this? Like singing in a British accent just doesn't work. Same goes for Eliza doolittle but I think she sings better than Lily Allen *although I ain't a fan of Eliza's singing*. newlinechar  newlinechar When I sing along to songs, I try to mimick how the singer is singing. So if they sing in a different accent to mine (southern English accent), then I sing to their accent. But I don't sing seriously, I sing for fun lol.

I 100% understand your situation.  I was LPO of a shop who had a member who was mid therapy stage through both the acceptance and the rebuttal phases.  It was turmoil for her (only using her because she hated the terms like 'zir/zim' until she personally felt comfortable to fully adopt the title and physical appearance of 'he/him').  Anyways, it was awful for her.  I felt like in the heat of the POTUS rebuking that I didn't know what to do for her but offer condolences.  Was a great tech, MP bare minimum on each eval, but it always hung over her head that at any moment all her effort and achievements would count for nothing and would be separated for who she was.  Our command was small and cool with her decisions, but still, what kind of career/life is that to worry that everything you've done for the nation would be rendered moot.  I hated it from a leadership position, I couldn't imagine how she dealt with it.

He dominated Eddie, so that 1 fight can't be used to discredit him. It's funny because before the fight a lot of people were suggesting Conor would get wrestle fucked and now that it's been over a year, he's turned into a 'stocky brawler with shitty takedowns'. Revisionist history at its finest. newlinechar  newlinechar At the time, McGregor was the featherweight champion. Keeping this in mind, he went 1-1 against a Nate Diaz who despite having double-digit losses, has insane cardio and a granite chin. At 170 lbs. He had a clear size disadvantage and despite losing at that weight once, he had the balls to do a rematch at the same weight, very well knowing that if he lost his credibility goes through the gutter. newlinechar  newlinechar In regards to Chad, same thing applies to him as Alvarez.

I'm a little embarrassed to say that I actually needed that little scene, but only because when the guy left a red footprint I thought he was bleeding (and I was super grossed-out when the guy went for a taste). After he said 'it's salt' it short-circuited my brain and allowed me to understand there was a red layer beneath the white one. newlinechar  newlinechar Of course, this became very obvious when the vehicles came out, so if they had removed the guy with the red footprint (and the weird salty vampire dude) it would've been more clear I feel. My guess is that whole exchange was there so people wouldn't think it was snow, but if you're going to put callbacks in your movie that are so visually similar to the movies that you're referencing that you have to insert extra scenes just to point out they are in fact a little bit different just to avoid confusion, maybe those callbacks are a little too on the nose...

Even it being something as silly as the act of creating a new account getting placed in the mempool and the account being inaccessible until it gets included in the next block...but then again I suppose that would just be an attack vector since you could weaponize that to inflate the mempool size and slow down the network.... newlinechar  newlinechar But yeah, idk, being able to spam new wallets seems like a design flaw that should be addressed imo.

All the ones with popular YouTubers are worth watching. So Sargon of Akkad, Lauren Southern, VeganGains, Nick Fetuses and  MisterMetokur. Also search for the Ethnic Nationalism debate. It's 2 parts, and pretty good imo. newlinechar  newlinechar The following aren't very serious/informative but are entertaining. JonTron (this one isn't greatly informative, but it's important for a lot of other things), NoBullshit, Athene (this isn't too enjoyable and depends if you like the topic), 'female Trump support from /pol/', his debate with a 15 year old Trump fan and basically all the ones about edgy topics like pedos and incest, NakedApe. Other interesting ones are the 5v1s where a bunch of well known people are debating. Britney Ventti debates are also hilarious. newlinechar  newlinechar For your debates where Destiny gets destroyed, that's up to you to make that decision. I don't really think that's happened, but he has had debates with well informed individuals where the opposing side can be more knowledgeable about certain topics. For those watch the Martin Shrekli, Jacob Wohl, Ryan Dawson and probably some others. When Destiny doesn't know about shit he usually just turns the discussion towards a direction which allows him to learn what the other person is saying and he usually spends the streams after that doing research about that topic.
I also think so myself. Although I do believe the next female boss character is Maki Kagura and Elizabeth B.

I think people view 'the decline' differently. newlinechar  newlinechar On one hand, you lost the populism of WoW among gaming communities because of this QOL changes went so hard. newlinechar  newlinechar On the other hand, overall numbers increased as a result of QOL changes. newlinechar  newlinechar But many of us left because we were no longer having the experiences that made the game fun for us.  newlinechar  newlinechar We used to run to Blackrock mountain, and kill everyone on our way. Find another group on our sever grouping for their weekly molten core, and get into a skirmish. Then we went into blackwing lair with 40 people. At least half of them you've developed very close relationships to- farming together for prep, making PvP teams to be the best on the server. On the realm forums people would call you out by name as the best of your class, and your group and a collective sigh when they recognized your name. newlinechar  newlinechar Once upon a time, you had world dragons causing cross faction fights, and people just there for the ganking, or to kill the other side and get the dragon.  newlinechar  newlinechar You had informal relationships with prominent members of the opposing faction- sometimes even giving them an attempt so they would then give you an attempt if they wiped. These alliances were unspoken and informal and could go off at any minute. newlinechar  newlinechar You'd roll into an area with your alt and find that guy that was ganking you, and you take your vengeance. newlinechar  newlinechar You do silly shit, like farm for the bootybay pirate hat and set off all the guards. Or claimed the crossroads as your own from the alliance side. newlinechar  newlinechar Low level dungeons were challenging. I remember not finishing some of them multiple times. But when you did, and you got that new weapon, you were ready to use it in pvp.  newlinechar  newlinechar This was the WoW we knew and loved.  newlinechar  newlinechar Now leveling is mindless. Nobody knows you. You can't be blacklisted for ninja looting. You don't run into other raid parties and break out in war. You don't have PVP groups recognized and feared. There is no travel, just menus. newlinechar  newlinechar You role through dungeons without a remote fear of dying. Hogger is no longer feared.  newlinechar  newlinechar This lead to a decline of many players, but a new influx of casual players and other gamers.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar If ESO would've followed through on their promises about the justice system, thieves and constables in the open world, I think it would've attracted a lot of people to make these experiences again.  newlinechar  newlinechar **TL/DR** newlinechar  newlinechar The reason people want vanilla, and miss old WoW isn't because of 'the cool new boss'. And wanting access to it. They miss it because so many interactions and experiences are now gone from the game because of the changes they made.  newlinechar  newlinechar Many new games already had these systems so nobody lost these experiences, nor do these games offer world pvp anyway, which was a big part of interactions and experiences lost. newlinechar  newlinechar It's honestly why most of us old wow players moved onto other games and genres.  newlinechar

In theory, that sounds better than the British system. The houses provided by the council are selected council houses which are supposed to be safe to live in. The residents pay the bills and rent and all that, though they can sometimes issue benefits if you are eligble. However, if there is something wrong with the actual house, to my knowledge, it will be sorted by the council. It really depends. My brother ripped his bedroom door off and my mother had to pay for a new one, and he put a hole in mine, so things like that you have to pay.  newlinechar  newlinechar It seems similar. I wouldn't be surprised if they were not only similar, but had the same sort of problems.

UFC on Fox gets 1-2 million viewers, FS1 ~500k and demographically probably makes much more sense for people who might be interested in motorcycle riding. Again - advertising a model is unnecessary. Once people are interested in motorcycles they go deep.

&gt; There are good reasons for Luke being as depressed and despondent as he is in the second movie, but it's more than just Ben going to the dark side. newlinechar  newlinechar Yes, it's also that Leia trusted him with her son and he failed her, and also Ben killed most of the other students when he turned and the rest went with him, and also that Luke was unable to see Snoke's influence in Ben just like the Jedi were unable to see Palpatine's influence in the Clone Wars. That last one in particular was probably the most significant factor in Luke abandoning the Jedi. He didn't want to repeat the mistakes that led to the downfall of the Jedi and the rise of the Sith and even so that's exactly what happened.

Is there any reason you want critics specifically? If it's just because you don't want a bunch of people saying *the Dark Knight* and *The Shawshank Redemption* are the best movies ever made by human beings, then I suggest [Criticker](https://www.criticker.com). It includes rankings from everyone, not just critics, but the way it works is that it generates ratings for unseen movies by using the ratings of users who have similar tastes to your own. This means it ends up being scary accurate. You can pick how to rate movies, and I rate movies out of 100 and it's rarely more than 5 points off. So for instance if it thinks I'll give a movie an 81 out of 100, that's usually about what I give a movie once I see it.

I think for (non-housing) investment you can only claim deductions on income earned from the actual investment. newlinechar  newlinechar In this instance, i believe you can't claim more than what you've earned mining bitcoin.  newlinechar  newlinechar Of course considering the price of Bitcoin now the amount earned is probably a crap load anyway.
If personal performance was removed, you‚Äôd have a lot of Masters players buying bronze accounts and surfing for 30X as long. That‚Äôs the reason it‚Äôs there, so Blizzard can single out those people and put them on fast tracks to high ranks. But after Diamond that doesn‚Äôt matter as much, so they‚Äôre removing it. It‚Äôs a necessarily evil to combat smurfs 
OMG i just had a quick look over there - thanks for sharing! I had no idea about the world of cast iron! Mine is brand spanking new - all those hand me down ones look a hell of a lot nicer than mine! but I will absolutely post - im a bit nervous about using it now that i finally got my hands on it!  newlinechar 
Rock braining Mankind with a chair a dozen times at the Rumble is only a hair shy of Mankind being thrown off the cage. 
Which means you're not a #LeftWingLiberalFaggot?
Gonna have to let us all kiss your wife next season. You know, for the good of the team.
Nah. Not interested in scapegoating one guy for a pitiful offense and questionable at times defense.  newlinechar  newlinechar The Seahawks are the reason the Seahawks are not going to the playoffs.

Yeah Reddit is fucking dumb when it comes to knowing how procedures and laws work. I've been downvoted before for refusing to sue an American company that gave me, a NZer, a bad experience. And by 'refusing to sue' I mean explicitly pointing out that the TV laws these people were trying to cite don't exist in my country, let alone theirs.  newlinechar  newlinechar Animal welfare isn't going to care about someone unintentionally hurting an animal because they thought they were helping, and then quickly apologising and paying for vet bills and doing everything they can to help the lizards who are going to make a full recovery.
