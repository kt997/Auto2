Why the fuck would you sit Cooks for Dede? Cooks is a top 12 WR for fantasy scoring, while Dede has had like 3 acceptable games this year. And the Pats needed the win to secure home field and were playing the shitty Jets.
Not going for a field goal on 2nd down with plenty of time while down by more than 7 would be a start.
I completely agree. And his base is dwindling by the minute. To be frank, most of them were just caught up in the excitement of the election.

You just gotta pay an aggregator to upload it to iTunes, you can fill out any artist name you want, and iTunes themselves will file it in with the artist name you chose. So if I pay TuneCore $30 to upload my song, and I make the name 21 Savage, that album would get put up under 21 Savage, which would, most of the time (unless they have a label that is good at catching these things), make it on the 21 Savage artist page.

And the point I'm making is that it's due to subject distance, not focal length / telephoto lenses.  Again, you should actually read the article.  The perceived distance between them is because they are further away from the camera than they are from each other.  Look at the posts in the background of the 'wide' shot and you can see the same effect occurring. newlinechar  newlinechar The camera is 1.5 million km from the moon, the moon is only 384 thousand from the earth, this large subject distance is what results in the 'compression', the focal length is only zooming in on a relationship that already exists physically between the viewpoint, foreground, and background object.

Hey i main an orc shammy too! The class is really fun, whether you’re healing or damaging. Yeah the beginner quests are rather straightforward and don’t demand too much out of you. Basically at lower levels they’re just basic easy tasks to help you learn your class better and explore the world. When you get to higher levels though there’ll be a central hub for an area that includes an overarching story for your class and character. In some areas the landscape and enemies will actually permanently change to reflect what you’ve done on quests.

Might depend on the coin. XRB is a totally separate blockchain, so that might be harder to integrate.
You shouldn’t have an issue hitting 1080p 60fps in most games with that setup. Some older games you’d probably hit a bit higher than that. You may want to bring your total amount of ram to 8gb though, as 8gb has kinda become the minimum and 16gb is the recommended amount. But with DDR4 being so expensive right now, 8gb is really the most you should get for a budget like this.

Honestly, Intel is actually better for gaming. Ryzen is a bit cheaper though. I suggested an Intel 8600k to another builder here, and they all downvoted me and called me an Intel shill - even though it would have been better than an R5 1600. newlinechar  newlinechar The only reason why I got you the Ryzen other than its pricing is since it would allow me to use a GTX 1080.

I see a whole variety of issues with that approach. Firstly, how much of a nation is needed to form the 'allowed to overthrow our ruler' entity? Every single individual besides the ruler? 95%? Simple majority? Seems completely arbitrary whichever you choose. newlinechar  newlinechar Secondly, the ruler is in authority over the nation, even if the whole nation doesn't like it (practically speaking, if everyone doesn't like it the ruler won't be in authority anymore anyway. Rulers need some means of carrying out their will beyond mere 'I'm the captain now'). The nation doesn't have some God-given authority to overthrow their ruler. The Reformers' view that lesser magistrates could overthrow higher magistrates who broke the law is far more useful and defensible.  newlinechar  newlinechar Thirdly, the ruler may be obligated to keep the law of God, but that doesn't give 'the nation' the authority to overthrow him when he doesn't. It may give the lesser magistrate authority, but not 'the nation'. I don't know of anywhere in the Bible where the concept of the nation having a single identity and authority over its rulers exists.

I do everything on my phone, from audio/video recording to pictures and often edit/create content from there.

I think the exception, if any such exception exists, would be in finding a cycle that's different to 4-2-1. It's been proved that if such a cycle exists, it must be [pretty damn big](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture#Cycles), but yeah: as far as I can see, the whole constant-growing thing is *probably* a dead end. newlinechar  newlinechar EDIT: OK, right... that makes more sense. The issue isn't that the numbers grow forever -- that much is impossible, as you rightly point out -- but that *sets* of numbers might grow forever. Say you have an odd number *x*, so you do your 3n+1, and you're left with an even number which you then divide by 2 to get your number *y*. If *y* is odd, it will grow again if you put it through the same process to get a new number *z*, and so on, and so on. In only becomes a smaller number if the new number is divisible by 4. *In theory*, I can't see a reason why these cycles of numbers couldn't keep getting bigger forever, which is why it's not a complete dead end. It would be a jagged upward line, but it would still be a line that trended upwards forever, if that makes sense. Trying to find a different loop (other than 4-2-1) feels like it would be more fruitful, though.

If your monthly rent is $850, then your yearly rent is $10,200. Now there's 13 months instead of 12, so divide $10,200 by 13 and you get $784.62.  newlinechar  newlinechar But after I typed that, I realized what you're saying is 'nobody would actually decrease the payments, they'd just bill an extra month' which is possible, but surely wouldn't fly across the board.

&gt; It would be silly to say it doesn't. Can you find a person who would disagree with this? newlinechar  newlinechar With the idea that we are constrained by determinism? Compatibilists deny this because they don't think determinism is a constraint, and incompatibilists deny this because they deny determinism. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Well that goes back to the case of metaphysical libertarianism but honestly that raises more questions than it answers because it requires that the events in the brain that lead to the performance of actions do not have an entirely physical explanation, and consequently the world is not closed under physics. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof and for that claim the burden of proof might be just too heavy. newlinechar  newlinechar I would humbly submit that you are in absolutely no position to be passing judgment on the merits of incompatibilism or any other position in the free will debate, because you haven't even gotten clear on the basics of the debate, let alone extensively studied the various alternatives in order to be able to make an informed judgment. Right now you're in the position of someone who thinks that weather might be caused by the gods being angry at us who is passing judgment on a cutting edge claim about global warming made by a climate scientist. Even if we could get this person to agree that weather is not caused by the gods, it's going to take a lot of learning before we think they're anywhere near the point where they can pass judgment on what cutting edge climate science has to say.

Classic cards are sometimes moved to the Hall of Fame. newlinechar  newlinechar This happens when they're too strong to be left in the evergreen set in Standard, and are used in a lot of decks from various classes, largely defeating the point of standard having a rotation with new cards supposed to be replacing old ones.

It’s in every country but the United States. And it’s weirdly legal to bring back in person but not to ship so you’ll have no issue with customs.

No one truly know how SR works behind the hood. We can make educated guesses, but its hard to actually test those hypothesis.  newlinechar  newlinechar Many people believe that playing a low-pick hero improve your SR gains if you can actually perform well on them because there is less data on how well those heroes should perform. Yet, you don't see solid data that confirm that. No one made a (eg) Mei-only account, then a Tracer-only account, noted down all the end-of-game data of each map, and compared them with the amount of SR change after each match.  newlinechar  newlinechar So, IMO, you should use Blizzard guidelines: Play your best/favorite heroes, switch if you think a different hero would be better to either beat the enemy formation or synergize with your team, always play to win, and trust that your teammates are also doing their best to win as well.

It was actually incredibly straight forward. I snipped the leads that ran to the internal speaker and the leads going to the vertical and horizontal deflection coils.

Yeah a lot of people are extremely cautious which is understandable.

Who can say until faces of neoliberal week.
Notice the word Revenue.  Cutting revenue increases the deficit.  Republicans know this because they set the tax cuts to expire to get around rules that state they can't increase the deficit after a 10 year window.  Also, there is nothing socially liberal about Trump.  Not on the environment, not on police brutality, not on abortion.  We heard that before the election and every appointment he has made has shown that to be bullshit.  He has so poisoned the well that there is no incentive for Democrats to cooperate with him on anything.    
I strongly dislike the poppy sound. Instrumentation is generic. Vocals are too produced. Production overall has been Butched, referring to the drum machine, vocal production, synth choices, overall mainstream pop sound. Lyrics sound forced. It also left a bad taste in my mouth because it was the first taste of the new Weezer era, which I just want to be ended.
Oh... uh, yes, that might actually have happened. This is a little embarrassing.
Haha preaching the truth. Good amount of protein for less than a dollar, and pretty tasty. Hell, I'm making some right now!

I’m from Northern Europe.  newlinechar  newlinechar I agree with you, America has a ridiculously high infant mortality rate for a western country.

Sowell calls it the cracker culture. He traced the culture of poor blacks in America today to a small area in Scotland I think it was.  newlinechar  newlinechar Actually, here ya go : newlinechar  newlinechar https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Rednecks_and_White_Liberals newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Sowell argues that the black ghetto culture, which is claimed to be 'authentic black culture', is actually a highly dysfunctional white southern redneck culture which existed during the antebellum South. This culture came, in turn, from the 'Cracker culture' of the North Britons and Scots-Irish who migrated from the generally lawless border regions of Britain. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Sowell gives a number of examples that he regards as supporting the lineage, e.g., newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; an aversion to work, proneness to violence, neglect of education, sexual promiscuity, improvidence, drunkenness, lack of entrepreneurship,… and a style of religious oratory marked by strident rhetoric, unbridled emotions, and flamboyant imagery.[1]
They also had to go on: the caller said the house was 1 story, and the one they came to was 2 stories. Yeah, he said he poured gasoline all over the house, but *there was no smell of gasoline.* Officers should be cognizant that swatting is a thing - this isn't the first and only incident. If officers aren't wondering if it's real, well, obviously they fucking need to. What do I expect the officer to do? I expect him to *assess the situation before him.* At that distance, and with plenty of cover, I expect him to wait to *see an actual weapon.* There was none. I expect them to give a man opportunity to surrender. 
I’ll keep an eye out for this, thinking of bringing some people there.

I agree about the law. I want all laws removed from the books that prohibit peaceful people from forming voluntary associations with one another.

We have AutoMod remove comments from users with accounts under 10 hours old, and users that get down to -10karma on comments.

HA! I had the same feeling when I was grinding him in casuals early on, and it's most likely not your build at fault here. I think of it as the 'Fafnir syndrome' where after transforming you feel like you're less tanky, I think it has to do with your model becoming bigger and easier to see in teamfights(and generally when you're transforming you're in the middle of the fight) so it's harder to juke/hide. newlinechar  newlinechar Glad shield is more noticeable in the small 1v1 or 1v2 fights not in the bigger lategame scenarios, it gives a fake illusion of having really good sustain but you still have to play carefully and not dive in without having a good build.
You can trade skins, use them and collect them. Also you’re associating the level of interactivity with the enjoyment someone gets from them which might be true for you but isn’t for everyone and that doesn’t make them wrong.

It's very telling she says 'downstairs' and not vagina. I wonder if she's talked to her child yet about what to do if anyone touches her vagina.

It was someone I trusted so I couldn't figure out why he was touching me there.

Hmmm let me think.  I havent been watching a lot of movies lately.  Superbad is always good haha.  If you're looking for funny shows I would highly recommend GLOW on netflix.  It's funny but it also has a lot more to it.  It's really good.  Also any of Marc Maron's stand up specials (he has a few on netflix). He's more of a 'im gonna stand here and vent and have a mini breakdown but you kinda get it to so you laugh both at me and with me but we both know life is pointless and we're gonna die' comedian.  I highly recommend him lol Tom Segura has a lot of good stand up too. He is way less existential crisis-y if that's not what you like.  Even though I totally veered away from your question I hope I helped haha   newlinechar  newlinechar They also have their albums on spotify if you dont have netflix

It was legit a while ago. Then tech came to San Francisco and the housing market got hot, hot enough to attract rampant foreign investment from China. This made the average rent go up several hundred percent very, very quickly, and stay on that trend for several years. This caused the middle class to bail either to the burbs or other west coast cities. newlinechar  newlinechar I think most of this applies to Seattle as well, and Portland being stuck between the two caught the brunt of 'poor' San Franciscians and Seattleites blowing up their housing market. All of this made a great environment for a ton of both wandering and native homeless across the board, which brings drugs and all the usual shit along with it. newlinechar  newlinechar Long story short, I'd move back to my hometown of Denver tomorrow but the home prices are up over double what they were in even the 7-8 years since I left. I don't cheer for people losing in the RE market, but I personally am praying for rain.

Instead of staying in the ignorance of 'we should do nothing with nuclear' we should investing into more projects where the remaining waste can be recycled until a tiny to no existing amount is over.

that would mean that the price of the current tanks still stays the same. becouse there are 10 times as many and the money distribution is based on new purchases. better to implement a percentage of the money from a market sell to be distributed to all current tank holders this way the prices also level a little bit more after market is released because the price on the market is also higher because the extra fee.

Even if a gamer pirates a game which they had no intent to pay for, and shares knowledge about the game with other gamers, it's a loss for the developer because having access to paid content for free sets a precedent that discourages other potential buyers from buying the game if there is a way that they can get it for free. newlinechar  newlinechar You may argue that piracy has no major effect on sales numbers, but piracy, in its most basic form, is and always will be stealing. You are taking paid content, which holds value, for free. A paid game is an asset with value in it. If gamer A purchases a game, while gamer B pirates a game for free, gamer B now owns an asset that was worth X dollars that gamer A paid for. The fact that you try to justify and defend people stealing these games 'just because it happens on a small scale' is despicable.

What think about Ripple, Monero and Cardano? Isn't Cardano a 3rd generation coin? I've heard people say that Cardano is a coin you wanna hold.

A whopping 50% market cap share loss. newlinechar  newlinechar Isn't that a bit worrying?

&gt;So an ancap who wants to attempt to create an equal society by implementing capitalism newlinechar  newlinechar Anarcho-capitalism is a contradiction in terms. Anarchism is a rejection of hierarchical leadership and authority in social relationships. Capitalism, on the other hand, requires the existence of dominant and subordinate classes. For capital to be accumulated, the working class must be exploited and oppressed by the owning class, as Marx rigorously demonstrates over hundreds of pages in the volumes of *Capital*. Capitalism requires a hierarchical division of labor and classes. Moreover, all of the 'intellectuals' associated with anarcho-capitalism understand anarchy not as a condition in which there is no hierarchical authority, but rather a condition in which there is simply no state to regulate capitalism or to interfere in the accumulation of capital. Thinkers from Rothbard to Hoppe to Nozick all openly *embrace* what they understand as inherent inequality between people and all argue that domination of the weak by the strong is the natural state of things and is an expression of anarchy in that there is no government or state to intervene in this natural order of things.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;And a syndicalist who wants to try and climb the socialist corporate ladder through his own work is a right winger? newlinechar  newlinechar Why would a society in which property is held in common have a hierarchical corporate ladder? For Marx, socialism is the negation of capital and the existing division of labor. Additionally, as Bordiga observed, the hell of capitalism is the firm itself. A socialist society is not going to retain the corporate hierarchy as a means of organizing production. You have no understanding of what capitalism or socialism or anarchism even are, stop pretending like you're some kind of intellectual authority here.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;At its core, Left-wing means anti-private property and Right-wing means pro-private property. newlinechar  newlinechar And yet, there are strains of leftism such as mutualism that are pro-private property and forms of fascism that want all property to be national property.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Unless you aren't a marxist of course. newlinechar  newlinechar I am a Marxist, and I am *categorically* telling you that you have absolutely no understanding of Marxism, or, frankly, political theory in general.

No, that advice is wrong. You want to split them over the channels so as to maintain dual channel operation.

&gt; I referenced this already. If there's an issue with therapists reporting clients for pedophilia, then that's a reason for working to improve confidentiality in therapy sessions. But that doesn't mean we should remove the stigma from society at large. newlinechar  newlinechar The reason therapists illegally go against confidentiality in these situations is because of the stigma. Therapists are human and many of them (even with their education) don’t think that there can be non-offending pedophiles. They report them out of fear and the idea of “protecting the children” when the person who sought therapy has never touched a child and sought therapy for the express purpose of never touching a child.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; I’m saying removing the stigma against pedophilia will make it socially acceptable and thus more common. If pedophilia is more common, then pedophilic acts  be more common as well. Of course, this is making the assumption that if there are more people with a desire to do X, then more people will do X (which seems to be a valid assumption to me). newlinechar  newlinechar And this is where we disagree. I don’t think otherwise non-pedophilic people are going to suddenly want to have sex with children if we remove the stigma. newlinechar  newlinechar The whole point is that stigma or no, these people exist. And we don’t know what causes them to have these feelings. Do you know why you are straight/gay/whatever? Do you remember the moment you decided to be that way? No. Because you didn’t decide. You just were. Just like no one is going to decide to be a pedophile just because we may remove the stigma for seeking treatment.  newlinechar  newlinechar Read *The Other Side Of Desire* by Daniel Bergner. It’s fascinating.

&gt; The funny thing is that you are likely supporting the FBI's and deep states' attempted coup to take down Trump. newlinechar  newlinechar And what makes you say that? Listen, nothing is absolute. 'Deep state' isn't some official club that has taken over 100% of the American government. The government is made up of the people.

Different people have different motivations. I don't know Trump personally. Do I trust him more than Clinton? Probably, but the real goal is to have our system set up so we don't *need* to trust these people. That's why there is a little thing called the United States Constitution. It specifically limits power as appropriate. We just need to get back to following it. newlinechar  newlinechar Trump needs to let the system work. That's his biggest problem. He thinks he's somehow above everything. He's not. It's fine to not lie down and take it when people come after you, but Trump acts like he's right 100% of the time and can't ever be faulted by anyone. The man isn't a god. He's not faultless. He needs to stop being so defensive and forceful. All he's doing is ensuring he doesn't get re-elected. People are watching everything, they're paying attention to politics now, which is good. Trump needs to stay focused on his strengths and stop picking fights with every single person because when he does that he weakens his own hand. That's nothing to do with any conspiracy take down. That's Trump himself. newlinechar

The two issues were that your bowl had very high nitrates (this is a carcinogen generated from their waste) that lowered your fish's lifespan and their overall health. The second is that betta fish (like most fish) will get bored/stressed if their environment doesn't have enough stimulation.

If you were missing a filter/heater, that would compound the issues even more and would mean you had nitrites in your tank, which is far more toxic than nitrates. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm not saying it isn't possible for the fish to live a few years in shitty conditions, I'm just saying that it's an abusive and difficult condition to leave the fish under.

If an end even exists. More of a sobering night for me than anything else.
&gt; If anything ellison's the idiot for offering such a cushy job to someone with no background/credentials, so the critique should be with his decisionmaking and how unlikely it is someone in his position would realistically make that kind of offer (or give karen so much leeway at work). newlinechar  newlinechar That's the sort of decision where HR would more than likely have to vet Karen through a background check, resume, and references and all that good shit before even considering her for a cubicle in the newsroom.

&gt;You are misunderstanding what I’m saying, my man.

You're trying (and failing btw) to mislead people with your own unverified version of a study you clearly do not have the expertise to criticize meaningfully. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Many think that if you find correlation and a causal relationship seems reasonable, that you can assume you’ve found causation newlinechar  newlinechar Yeah, this a long winded way of saying 'correlation doesn't mean causation' and considering the paper **does not say correlation, causation or even casual**. I can safely say you are lying about the content of the paper itself. It's piss take that you call yourself an statistician and you're hand waving a massive paper about statistics on the basis of a set of words that were never mentioned in the paper. newlinechar  newlinechar This is an embarrassment if you are actually a statistician. If you actually work in a profession on basis of that expertise you should do the honest and right thing right now and quit because you are not qualified in the slightest to be one and literally stealing from your employer  newlinechar   newlinechar &gt;that you can assume you’ve found causation - but it can’t be proven and therefore a study claiming to find such a conclusion is bunk newlinechar  newlinechar Let the record show that a self proclaimed 'statistician' is saying it's impossible to prove any relationship ever. newlinechar  newlinechar Again, it seems you didn't actually read the paper. You're simply lying about the paper and being dishonest.

Wentz is gone, offense struggled against an Oakland team that couldn't hold onto the ball for more than a minute for their lives, and the defense struggled earlier against the Rams and almost gave up 30 to the Giants.

&gt; I'm childfree, but I want a long-term partner. I do not want to date men who are not interested in finding a long-term partner.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; If a guy in his early 30's wants to date a woman in her early 20's, that is a dealbreaker for me. Not a friend dealbreaker, but a dating dealbreaker. He is not really interested in real relationships or connecting with someone. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar My main goal is to find a long-term partner but I don't have a particular timetable for that happening. I'm not opposed to casual dating, but my preference would be if I do casually date I'd want it to be with people who are at least open to the possibility of a relationship evolving into something long term. I'm specifically NOT seeking short term hookups (though I wouldn't be surprised if that ends up happening inadvertently if I get ghosted after sleeping with someone one or two times).  newlinechar  newlinechar I'm currently on the fence about whether to have children, but increasingly leaning toward not having them as I get older. If I matched with a woman who was certain she did not want to have children I would be OK with that (and after getting married I'd be willing to get a vasectomy if need be).  newlinechar  newlinechar Likewise if I matched with a woman who was on the fence or who expressed an interest in having a child, just not on a short timetable, I'd be fine with that as well. I'd want to have a few pressure-free years together, then if we made a mutual decision to have kids, have some lead time to prepare (to the extent one can prepare) by doing things like taking parenting classes, babysitting for friends etc.  Just about the only realistic way this scenario could play out is if I find someone younger than my age. But while I'm open to that as a possibility it's not a requirement.  newlinechar  newlinechar Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be a way for someone whose preferences similar to mine (prefers LTR but open to casual, on the fence about kids, not picky about age) to communicate them without other people suspecting they're lying about their intentions or seeking hookups.

&gt;Hijra is a term given to eunuchs, intersex people, and transgender people in South Asia. They are also known as Aravani, Aruvani or Jagappa. In many languages of India, especially outside North-West India, other terms are used such as chhakka. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Hijras are officially recognized as third gender in South Asian countries, being considered neither completely male nor female. Hijras have a recorded history in the Indian subcontinent from antiquity onwards as suggested by the Kama Sutraperiod. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Many hijras live in well-defined and organised all-hijracommunities, led by a guru. These communities have sustained themselves over generations by 'adopting' boys who are in abject poverty, rejected by, or flee, their family of origin. Many work as sex workers for survival. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;The word 'hijra' is a Hindi-Urdu word, derived from the Semitic Arabic root hjr in its sense of 'leaving one's tribe'. The Indian usage has traditionally been translated into English as 'eunuch' or 'hermaphrodite', where 'the irregularity of the male genitalia is central to the definition.' However, in general hijras are born male, only a few having been born with intersex variations. Some Hijras undergo an initiation rite into the hijra community called nirwaan, which refers to the removal of the penis, scrotum and testicles. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Since the late 20th century, some hijra activists and Western non-government organizations (NGOs) have lobbied for official recognition of the hijra as a kind of 'third sex' or 'third gender', as neither man nor woman. Hijras have successfully gained this recognition in Bangladesh and are eligible for priority in education. In India, the Supreme Court in April 2014 recognised hijra and transgender, eunuchs, intersex people as a 'third gender' in law. Nepal, Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh have all legally accepted the existence of a third gender, with India including an option for them on passports and certain official documents. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Most hijras live at the margins of society with very low status; the very word 'hijra' is sometimes used in a derogatory manner. The Indian lawyer and author Rajesh Talwar has written a book highlighting the human rights abuses suffered by the community titled 'The Third Sex and Human Rights.' Few employment opportunities are available to hijras. Many get their income from extortion (forced payment by disrupting work/life using demonstrations and interference), performing at ceremonies (toli), begging (dheengna), or sex work('raarha')—an occupation of eunuchs also recorded in premodern times. Violence against hijras, especially hijra sex workers, is often brutal, and occurs in public spaces, police stations, prisons, and their homes. As with transgender people in most of the world, they face extreme discrimination in health, housing, education, employment, immigration, law, and any bureaucracy that is unable to place them into male or female gender categories. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;In 2008, HIV prevalence was 27.6% amongst hijra sex workers in Larkana, Pakistan. The general prevalence of HIV among the adult Pakistani population is estimated at 0.1%. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;In October 2013, Pakistani Christians and Muslims (Shia and Sunni) put pressure on the landlords of Imamia Colony to evict any transgender residents. 'Generally in Pakistan, Khwaja Sira are not under threat. But they are in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province because of a 'new Islam' under way', I.A. Rehman, the director of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;In a study of Bangladeshi hijras, participants reported not being allowed to seek healthcare at the private chambers of doctors, and experiencing abuse if they go to government hospitals. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Beginning in 2006, hijras were engaged to accompany Patna city revenue officials to collect unpaid taxes, receiving a 4-percent commission. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Since India's Supreme Court re-criminalized homosexual sex on 13 December 2013, there has been a sharp increase in the physical, psychological and sexual violence against the transgendercommunity by the Indian Police Service, nor are they investigating even when sexual assault against them is reported. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;On 15 April 2014, in National Legal Services Authority v. Union of India, the Supreme Court of India ruled that transgender people should be treated as a third category of gender or as a socially and economically 'backward' class entitled to proportional access and representation in education and jobs. newlinechar  newlinechar https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijra_(South_Asia)

Yeah I encountered the DNS setting while debugging someone else's Java program that had to be sure to handle very short TTLs. I've had to deal with a lot of Java *software* in production so you pick up a few things and opinions along the way as a result. newlinechar  newlinechar That's why I'm asking questions, I want to understand the language better than I do now. I'm not discounting that Java can be a good tool to use but it's sometimes used in places it was not designed for, it's a general purpose language but that does not mean it can or should solve any particular problem, and I want to better my own understanding so I'm not as biased when debates come up. There's no substitute for learning this through experience but when you're not using a language on a daily basis you're often better off asking questions instead of continuing to rely on your own assumptions.
I don't think he is worth a top 5 pick especially with all our teams holes I will take a RB in round 2 and have a better fit that has more of an impact. It's not that I hate Barkley but with a rookie QB I don't want to be behind the chains often, he has a great ability to break big plays but he also has quite a few plays where he gets nothing or does to much and loses yards. He is similar to David Johnson and he will get his big plays but personally I would rather have Guice or one of the second round guys

Assuming we really are the 3rd best defense, and that's not just because it is averaged with the earlier part of the season.... newlinechar A #3 defense in any particular year does not fit an Empire image.  The 2016 defense wasn't just #1 for a year, but a once in 20 years kind of defense.  In just 6 years, Alabama put out 3 defenses that could be considered contenders for 'Once in a lifetime' status. newlinechar  newlinechar Anyway, we are in a very different state right now.  Against Mississippi State, we looked less physical than Vanderbilt.  Against Auburn, probably due to a freshman signal caller, it seemed we couldn't disguise or surprise. It seemed that the only time we could stop the 3rd down crossing routes was when we had a timeout and Pruitt was able to prepare the play.  In the last two real games, we have been playing off our backfoot, with no real threat of disrupting the QB. newlinechar  newlinechar Of course, we get a whole new combination of linebackers against Clemson, so maybe we will look better, but I wouldn't bet on it.  People give us the benefit of the doubt because we are Alabama, but I think that in the years where we've had fatal flaws such as lack of depth or experience at certain positions, Saban's coaching magic was not able to mask it, as people seem to keep assuming it will.

It's three Organs, one in the brain that has most of the Primarch-ness to it, one behind the third lung that can just dump them full of combat stims and super-helaing juice if they take catastrophic damage (the justification for the second wound, I assume), and the third is more technological, being steel reinforcement cabling woven through their muscles. None of them requires the other organs to function (and the third you probably can't put in until just before the Black Carapace anyways, otherwise the marine will outgrow it and you'd have to go back again). So while there's probably a standard order they're implanted in during a scout's regular progressing through the ranks, there shouldn't be any reason you couldn't implant them all after the fact.

I'll run the idea of dissociation by my therapist at my next session. I had made a note of that earlier in life, I couldn't remember anything specific about the last 3-4 years of my life. Just kind of slipped in and out, but with huge gaps where I felt like time passed, but couldn't tell you what happened. I could pass a test on if something was true or false, but I couldn't lay out the events themselves without just confirming a timeline already written for me. newlinechar  newlinechar And sometimes I'll realize that I'm 'in real life', so to speak? Like I'll be at work and then realize that I'm a human in control of a body, and it'll give me a pause, maybe a bit of a start, and then I just go back to feeling 'normal' again, which is usually just me thinking about stuff while on autopilot physically. newlinechar  newlinechar The terms I use for my past life, future life, etc, is mostly ceremonial. I know it's my life, and that I'm one person with different descriptors. I just don't feel comfortable being referred to as either just yet. One I don't want anything to do with, the other I don't feel as though I deserve/earned it yet. newlinechar  newlinechar My family wouldn't outright disown me. They'd torture me under the guise of curiosity/concern/love and make things worse. I live with my father right now taking care of him, and I'm paying rent and utilities... actually I guess at this point he lives with *me*. He's very much of the alt-right persuasion, and as soon as he can stand on his own financially (see: gets his disability) he's promised to pay me back what I've given him. We'll see if that happens. newlinechar  newlinechar When I don't have to deal with guilt of leaving him by himself, I'll bail and just never speak to my family or friends ever again, probably. My friends, a couple I've come out to. I already only talk to them once every now and then. They seem supportive but they're very much uncomfortable with the whole idea. I wouldn't lose anything by leaving them. newlinechar  newlinechar That'd be a perfect scenario, but I can't get a job if I start transitioning, and I can promise that if I turn 30 and I've not gotten HRT figured out, the only passing I'll be doing is passing *on*. newlinechar  newlinechar But there's no reason why I can't get that sorted.

He mentioned his lack of empathy in other replies. Or that it's been noted before. newlinechar  newlinechar Yes, inability to ejaculate or orgasm is dysfunction.

Good discussion. Bitcoin runs on the ‘worlds-computer’ and is arguably more easily transferable (as opposed to perhaps holding physical gold blocks). It can also be divided into smaller or equal portions digitally and can be accessed from a somewhat decentralized network. It may also be used as your own, personal bank, from which you can add or subtract funds rather easily. This is why I am excited about the possibilities of the lightning network as it provides users with the ability to transfer funds between a savings/checking account type of system without having to rely on a third party.

Not many.  And I wonder how many people in the EU even own passports.

&gt;Okay, obviously this isn't true, but come on, if you found out that only one women ever made your boyfriend cum and that actually it wasn't just a 'him' issue but something she apparently had/did that you don't, are you telling me that wouldn't hurt like hell newlinechar  newlinechar Fun story: I've been through something like this.   I dated someone who had an extremely hard time orgasming during sex, especially with new partners.   He had only a handful of girlfriends before me and had only successfully reached climax via PIV intercourse with his first.  newlinechar  newlinechar Now, I was 30 and not 22 (**edit:** and I've had plenty of experience with different partners) but it didn't bother me a bit.   We took our time.   I got him off in other ways.  I didn't make it about me.  I didn't guilt him.  And, wouldn't you know, after 6 months he started coming with the strength and punctuality of a freight train (TMI?)  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I mean, even not in the girlfriend's shoes, I'm wondering what the deal is. It's very unusual to be able to orgasm normally with one person and then never again with 20+ other people. newlinechar  newlinechar It's actually not.  A lot of guys go off like a rocket during their first handful of sexual encounters.   For near-virgins, sex is novel and inherently super exciting.   That may wear off.  newlinechar  newlinechar Guys don't always come easily during sex.   It doesn't make them broken.    newlinechar  newlinechar

&gt;They WERE bad a Japan, Phy adult gohan sucks  newlinechar  newlinechar Again, the quality still doesn't matter, they are still exclusives.  And, what are you talking about with PHY Adult Gohan?  There is no PHY Adult Gohan that's exclusive to JPN...The only Gohan currently exclusive to JPN is LR Gohan, and we're not talking about him, we're talking about units that should have been out on GBL by now but aren't.   newlinechar  newlinechar And, again Yes, most of the exclusives are bad NOW. They weren't when they launched on JPN and when they should have launched on Global. Releasing them now, yes, they're useless. That's still kind of the problem, and it's the problem with the Battlefield units. Global missed out on units back when those units were useful.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Also why would they NOT bring battlefield to global, they are working on it and you have no proof that they are not coming out  newlinechar  newlinechar Why would they not give Tiencha to GBL?  Why would they delay INT Trunks' dokkan for so long?  Bamco's proven time and time again that they don't make sense.  But, yes, you're right, I have no proof that Battlefield isn't coming to Global, just like you have no proof that it is coming to Global.  Either way, it doesn't matter, because, again, the original point is that Japan has gotten this gamemode long long long before Global and Global should have had it launch by now.  Even if it came out tomorrow, it would still be months later that it should have come out.  Ergo, that's a shaft.   newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;And to the stones, one person does count stones given on global, and usually it’s at least 100 stones a month If your going to disprove me with stones, show actual evidence  newlinechar  newlinechar I like how you only said someone counts on Global but didn't mention how many stones JPN gets...I can gather actual evidence, but it'll take about a month, in the meantime, some basic logic will have to suffice.  That being that if Japan gets more stones from celebrations (for example, Japan gets 5 stones on Christmas day, Global gets 1.  Japan gets 50 stones for first login of the Christmas Celebration, Global got 10. ect), and if Japan gets stones every week for Dragon Ball Super but Global doesn't, that would kind of indicate that Japan gets more stones than Global.  If one version gets more stones overall than the other from various celebrations and just every week and everything else is the same...then that means that one version gets more stones than the other overall... newlinechar  newlinechar If you want an example right here right now, take a look at the New Years login celebrations between the two versions.  JPN gets 55 stones total.  Global gets 39.

This is a really good idea and would be an easy replace to the current trophies. You could just use the sticker files as trophies. This would also up the incentive in my opinion. newlinechar  newlinechar Only area where it would be bad would be some players would never get the gold for the team they root for.

OP came on to complain about being banned from a sub.  I explained that mods can do as they like, and in this case, the reason for the ban is legitimate...because of Pizzagate.   newlinechar  newlinechar You can't say that Pizzagate has any creditably having looked at the evidence.  The altered photos, the photos taken from social media and taken in other locations,  the proven alibis, no alleged victims have come forward at all.

I agree, but 'buy this!' 'look at the price of x', is not how the base of cryptocurrency should be built. If people want mass adoption and not pump/dump, There should be more indepth discussion about the tech behind the coin and cryptocurrency related projects.

Sadly, this is true. It's also common practice to throw away the cutter on the clingfilm, and soak the brand new box in water immediately after opening it. Also common to throw a pot that's still half full of sauce right into your new dish soap. The lemming mentality is strong in the kitchen.
&gt;And the electoral college is the only way a 3rd party has a possibility of winning. newlinechar  newlinechar ...*what?* That makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.  The electoral college is precisely why third-party votes are seen as wasted.  The candidate who wins the state wins all of the votes.  Did you vote for Jill Stein in Michigan?  Nope, the EC erased your vote, you actually voted for Trump.  Did you vote for Gary Johnson in California?  Nope the EC erased your vote, you actually voted for Clinton.  Your vote goes to whoever the winner of your state is, regardless of whether you actually hit the button with their name.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;And it's crucial we keep our Constitution in tact. newlinechar  newlinechar Bullshit.

Naw they wouldn't just go extinct. There would be wayyy less of them, but they wouldn't all die out. I have no doubt that plenty of animal sanctuaries would keep them on this planet if they were actually nearing extinction. newlinechar  newlinechar But if you actually are concerned with their extinction, can you think of any animal that we as humans have tried to save from extinction by actively participating in killing them? Does it make sense to be concerned with an animal going extinct... and then kill millions of them every year? Wouldn't it make more sense to do what we do for every other animal that we want to save from extinction? Ya know, help breed and protect them in sanctuaries with the intention of reintroducing them into the wild in some capacity? Farm animals aren't a part of an ecosystem, so if they disappeared from farms entirely there really wouldn't be any negative repercussions. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't avoid eating cows because I want to pet them, I do it because I don't want to hurt them if I don't have to.
OP wasn't open with her in the first place. He also gave her his password. That's not snooping, it was out in the open.

If you're having trouble having an orgasm as a male, go to the doctor, it could be an underlying issue. And not to mention, it's clearly causing issues in the relationship.

That's a part of it but they also held Gurley to his lowest yardage on the season and they were tied with the Rams until the 4th quarter. The team has just taken huge steps towards stopping the run this year and it shows with their YPG and their low amount of 10+ yard runs given up.

Ouch yes, I have a feeling a joke of that exact nature will be made, among others. It was brutal last year, bordering on not funny, so maybe Kimmel will ease up this year, as it's less funny and more true. I doubt it, though.

&gt;An external cost is still a cost in fact, and when imposed on society it represents a subsidy. You can't just pretend that the cost of fossil fuels exists in a vacuum - that is playing make-believe to suit the argument. newlinechar  newlinechar ok, in that case renewables loose hard because the materials for them are strip mined in China, which does incredible amounts of damage to the local environment. Of course, Trump is trying his hardest to change this by imposing protectionism onto the renewables industry. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Utterly trivial dollar-for-dollar compared to fossil fuels.  newlinechar  newlinechar It's not trivial, especially when China exploits their minerals so savagely and with such a hard disregard for environmental externalities. But you don't care about that because you're a westerner who will never go there. But the damage still happens, whether you like it or not.

Exactly. I'm a contractor so my truck is a necessity. With two kids and an 'active lifestyle' here in Canada we really couldn't get along with a wagon.

Yes i have forgotten that.It has 2 use cases: newlinechar  newlinechar - shielding against ulting enemys newlinechar - taking the battery/sattelite uplink more or less save. newlinechar  newlinechar But a super ability which is only usefull in 2 very specific cases and makes the gameplay worse, while using it in almost all other cases is just a bad super overall to have in the game. newlinechar  newlinechar  The whole design of uplink and overcharge just does not work in a fast paced game like this one. Those 2 modes are just bad/lazy constructed versions of a flagrun type gamemode. This whole idea of charging up the object in one small room leeds only to the entire team camping in this small room for most of the round instead of spreading out more over the map and gaining mapcontroll,which would promote cool fights over different areas of the map. They have basicaly created 3 gamemodes which reward camping on one spot for most of the round heavily and thats never a good thing in a game which values fast paced movement so much.  newlinechar  newlinechar They just need to go back onto the drawing board with at least those 3 modes (uplink,overcharge and occupy).Blitzball could also use some changes, so that they can finaly get rid of juggernaughts shield ability and replace it with something cool which promotes more active play and counterplay instead of static camping.

Yeah, it's slightly worrying that OP is throwing SO many (mostly bad) newlinechar reasons why this can't be true.

I suspect the same, but the ripples don't necessarily have to line up. The belts are, more than likely, gt2 so the notches are 2mm apart while the ripples are under 1mm. You have to account that the smooth idler has a diameter and that the belts teeth have an entry point and an exit point so the possible ripples should be, at least, twice that

You don’t have to make a Bamco account, but if you’re on iOS you just have to uninstall the game. Make sure to save your primary account if you haven’t. I think on android and such you just have to uninstall it as well, but there might be a way to delete the data file. I used Nox for faster rerolling, which you can delete a data file that deletes the account and let’s you start over without downloading anything. On iPhones it takes about 10 minutes per reroll, Nox is less than 5. If you can just delete the player data, like on Nox, there’s a trick where you can turn on auto for both walking and battling to make it and it’ll save the settings for any future rerolling accounts, which makes it a lot lazier and easier. I’d just watch Netflix and just tap through screens when I did it. I don’t remember the pathing for where the data files is, but the mods or a quick google search would help, I’m not at my computer atm.  newlinechar  newlinechar Please note that it’ll take a long time before a “good” account will likely show itself. If you’ve been playing for a long time, think about the daily gems and currencies you’ve been able to collect through events and such, and how you’ll lose that progress if you decide to scrap your primary account.

As much as I would enjoy that, that sounds like it would be super strenuous on development resources. Frankly, I'd rather have them both remade separately with the love and attention to detail they each deserve than together sharing so much content with only one dev team. It's like saying that Gaiden and Shadow Dragon should've shared a remake. It would be great if they were released separate and maybe bundled together later like the Metroid Prime Trilogy, or the Metal Gear Solid HD Collection with connective features? Idk, I just think that when we get Binding Blade in the west and when Blazing Blade gets updated they shouldn't be half-assed.

Nah. I personally think it's just monkey biting behavior but with a human twist. Men hate women because we are lower on the hierarchical totem. They abuse women instead of the men above them. They find extra satisfaction in harming 'beautiful' women because they sit higher on the female totem. So it's 'extra' power to harm highly desirable women. It's like being rich enough to be able to throw away an outfit after one use. It's a show of power.

Mobility is kind of a big deal when a large amount of official maps are asymmetrical and favor the generalist classes. newlinechar  newlinechar Spy is significantly more risky than Sniper. If a single person manages to see you (or even just knows there's a Spy on your team), you may as well just hit your kill bind and swap class. Either the entire team starts spychecking which forces you to give up, or you end up dying because someone turned around. newlinechar  newlinechar But with Sniper, it's not like that. You can still do well as a Sniper even if the enemy knows you have one. Sniper is harder to counter by nature. The element of surprise is currently Spy's main advantage, and I think the sheer danger of being a Spy is already enough of a downside. He doesn't need to be slow at setting up, too. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't see how a speed buff while cloaked would be a bad idea *if it were implemented correctly*. I can understand that if it were implemented poorly it could be a disaster, but that doesn't have to be the case. newlinechar  newlinechar I suggest making the speed buff only apply when the Spy is completely invisible. Any blinking (from damage or bumping into enemies) would cause the Spy to run at stock speed until he turns invisible again. This would reward the players who can avoid being hit but punishes the players who can't.

There’s a difference between being hopeful in the offseason for your team (aka being a fan) and shitting on everything your team does when they’re in a rebuild/transition phase because they’re not winning 10 games a year. newlinechar  newlinechar I just don’t understand the need to be so toxic. If you look at a lot of the moves Pace has made objectively, he’s been pretty decent. He’s drafted well (biggest thing in a rebuild) and made some good moves in Free Agency. He’s also made some very bad moves in Free Agency and has some misses in the draft. Guess what? So does literally every other GM in the league. We have a solid foundational core of players going forward, are an overall young team with no big deadweight contracts that will drag us down going forward. We’re really not in a bad spot. People like OP make it seem so much worse than it is. I get it, he is tired of seeing a losing team but winning in this league is hard and Pace has generally been doing the right thing in setting up this team to start making a push the next few years (mostly hinges on Trubisky to be fair). newlinechar  newlinechar

Understood, and yes she didn't say anything about kids.  However calling someone asking for help 'wet behind the ears' isn't helpful, it's condescending.  That's the crux of my message, and it's not anger but frustration that came through.  I agree with the rest of your advice, and thank you for offering suggestions, but please be aware that the age related portion of your post isn't necessarily helpful.

UKIP aren't far right. They only got 1.9% in the last election (2017). And even in 2015 they only got 1 seat, not 2. They currently have 0 seats. If you count 1.9% at a national election and 0 seats as a major party then fair enough though

They didn't, they just wanted to make some easy cash out of star wars fans. The movie doesn't need to be good, as long as it has star wars in the title, it's going to make money. Same thing happens/ed to many famous movies, and series.As long as it has the name of something in the title people will say 'oh, I remember that movie. Maybe this one will be good' This mentality has brought you some of the worst movies in history. The studios don't even have to try to make a movie thats good, or at least acceptable. Because it has a well known brand/product/movie/what ever in the title.
Yeah, same

There's plenty of reason to believe a bank would continue bad behaviour by being bailed out, but that's nothing to do with prolonging a recession.  newlinechar  newlinechar Are you aware that a recession is two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth? A bailout is certainly better than nothing in terms of the current economic situation since a bank failing (as in collapsing) is much worse than a bank behaving poorly.

Naturally. It's prudent to think critically, and without a bias slant, about the morals you are interested in. newlinechar  newlinechar At the very basic of it all, you just need to ask yourself 'is this belief based in logic and will it hurt anyone?'.

&gt;'pure Gacha' newlinechar  newlinechar It's...a bit more complicated than that.

This is a law actually designed to protect the consumer, and thank god, because it is ultimately the next step if loot boxes don't get curbed. It's the next 'Pandora's Box' for gaming. Imagine Star Wars Battlefront where you couldn't play Vader until you got Vader's Mask, Vader's Cape, Vader's Armor, and Vader's Lightsaber...and *each* of them was a rare pull.

Ah yes, the after baking warmth. My personal favorite was a hot shower to reset my body temperature. I'd try to pick a good time, where I wasn't planning on leaving the house.

Once done immediately drying as fast as you can and putting on the warmest clothes to keep the warmth for as long as you can.
I dont care about the Outfit or the Bodymesh. The Dialogue is the important part. Sofia is nice but I played a lot with her and her dialogue gets kinda repetetive after like 300hrs.

&gt; the problem is that throwing more money at problems doesn't always fix them.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar This wouldn't be 'throwing money at.' This would be adequate funding of so that states pay for operating expenses - so that debt of the student isn't created by lack of scholarships and by rising tuition. newlinechar  newlinechar Tuition like every other cost does go up though some state public universities have imposed a lid on it.

Hey neighbour! Or, an ex neighbour anyway. newlinechar  newlinechar I am not sure if USA should rank as a western country, mostly because of their crime rate, inprisonment rate, health care, family planning questions, teenage pregnancies, income differences, governing system and similar things.

I have a huge personal problem with reapers. They are like godmode stealth build master sergeant shinobis from lw2 right from the get-go. The one tile detection radius is broken and unrealistic and I even despise the graphical design. Some more futuristic chameleon-inspired armour with much shorter coat, to reduce noise would look more in-universe appropriate and also offer some explanation to the basically invisible stealth.  newlinechar  newlinechar Skirmishers have one of the best action economies in the game but rather bad damage. The second level of ripjack is their saving grace with that sweet guaranteed stun. Based on the aforementioned playthrough, the hero classes suffer from lack of scaling in reliable damage since their weapons aren't their main source of damage output. This was most notable in skirmishers, since rend is just godlike ability with parry and scout-build reapers don't rely on damage that much. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: I a word
Watch how clean the first punch that dropped Eddie landed. A clean left hand right on the point of the chin with Eddie inexplicably looking the other way. I think he was slightly hurt from that for the reminder of the round so the other knockdowns aren't a big surprise, imo. Then Conor put him away with a 3-punch combo. Poirier didn't land as clean at any point but he still hurt Eddie badly later on.  newlinechar  newlinechar I agree that Conor hits harder than Dustin but I don't think he's presents the danger of a 1-punch KO or agree with this talk of a guaranteed KO if Khabib keeps it on the feet for longer than 2 seconds.

Taking clones of people's consciousness into a digital reality for the purpose of torturing them, along with questions about morality over the torture of a digital intelligence. If you strip away the shallow Star Trek parody, it's really not very different (other than being muddied by plot holes and terrible comedy). It's admittedly also quite similar to the Star Trek TOS episode The Squire of Gothos, where a godlike alien takes the crew captive for the purpose of essentially playing with them as toys.

&gt; I know people on here say that Lowbo works off Deathstroke teams but I play PVP all the time and I have never seen this. newlinechar  newlinechar I've seen situations where you are forced to attack a Lowbo. Say, if you didn't have the dps to burst down Deathstroke by turn 2, then Lowbo taunts. Or maybe Lowbo attacked your HQ/CotA and got counter-killed. He revives with taunt and because your team is geared (faster) they keep HAVING to shoot Lowbo (usually with one shots) causing death-taunt loops. Hooray, Derpstroke can now one shot your G11 Cupes &gt;_&lt;; newlinechar  newlinechar Maybe you have the perfect counter teams, but a lot of people don't have the roster to deal with this.

I really disagree. He had a down year this year, for sure. Last year wasn't as good either (better than this year). But remember that since Hayward left and Shields got injured HHCD has not had a lot of time to be a traditional safety because the corners have needed so much help or the SS has been an extra linebacker in Nitro. Do not be surprised at all if he rebounds to form next year with a new scheme and reinforcements in the secondary.

I _think_, idk but I _think_ that the whole idea with the story is to explore the boundaries of horror. In essence, to replace a monster/ghost/killer clown with something even more basic in the psyche: disgust. I heard an interview with a social scientist (I believe) who was explaining their work on this topic, that disgust is much easier to study than horror or trauma, etc., because it is an immediate and visceral reaction, unable to be hidden. This story certainly tapped into that, for me, at least. Trapped in a port-a-potty of doom? yep, that would be my nightmare. Oh, and King threw in in-operable cancer, for good measure, as well, just in case that wasn't enough. newlinechar  newlinechar I remember reading on this sub a while back people talking about words they could not abide, with _moist_ coming out a clear un-favorite. So, everybody has their button; this story pressed mine. If it didn't press yours, maybe you are the lucky one :)

Sidious would still have needed to install himself in the republic and form the Empire if he wasnt Palpatine. There are a few ways it could have been done, but I kinda like the 'hiding in plain sight' plot they took with Sidious. He was literally there, the whole time, and they didnt realize how big of a threat he was until it was too late.

It isn't the worst thing ever. They could do an Airbender, make all the protagonists super white and turn the evil characters into Indians. Frankly The Way of Kings is a super racially charged story. You have a racist elite society who use darkeyed slaves as meat fodder in their war against a bunch of blackish red natives. There are so many ways they could get this wrong, they could very well just make everyone white caucasians and not bother with the racial implications at all like with Doctor Strange.

En effet la baisse de pouvoir de l'église est très ancienne en France,  le vrai combat entre l'église et les anti-cléricaux c'était surtout dans les années 1900-1950. Pour avoir une idée du retentissement de ce phénomène au niveau des villages du sud de la France, tu devrais regarder des films de l'époque, je pense notamment aux films de Marcel Pagnol même s'ils se passent passent plus à l'est (la femme du boulanger, la gloire de mon père) et aussi les films de Don Camillo (en Italie mais l'ambiance est similaire). On voit notamment apparaître la figure mythique de l'instituteur de village et du curé, ça te donnera sûrement des idées! newlinechar  newlinechar Sur le point des églises rénovées et vendues il me semble que c'est très rare en France, il me semble que c'est parce que les bâtiments religieux sont souvent des monuments historiques qui appartiennent à l'Etat (à vérifier), et qui sont mis à disposition de l'Eglise. Chaque village a encore son église en tous cas, j'en ai souvent vu des abandonnées mais jamais des rénovées.

I would push for a tax internship since that's what you're interested in. An internship is great but if it's in a field that you're not interested in, I'm not sure it's worth it. I would begin to apply now for internships for the winter as that is when you'd learn the most. Also network your ass off and get to know people - not only so people know your name, but so you can figure out which firms you want to work at. newlinechar  newlinechar I did what you mentioned - interned in the winter and then started full time right after. If you can get an internship, I absolutely think your school would be open to give you course credit. At my school I actually got 6 credits for the internship.

Humm... I prefer to think that we're just well past the 'golden era' of interstellar travel due to the the expansion of the universe and certain fundamental laws of physics as applied to our particular brand of energy gradient 'solution'. newlinechar  newlinechar There is, almost assuredly a point where the universe expands to the point where all life that emerges is isolated by distances too vast to comprehend, let alone navigate. newlinechar  newlinechar People forget (or are just plain ignorant) of the reality that the universe is only 14 billion years old and earth itself is only about 5 billion years old, with only the last couple of hundred million years being suitable for life.  That puts earth at roughly 10-13 billion years of universal expansion.  It gets confusing since the unit or measurement for the expansion of the universe is in 'kilometers per second per megaparsec' and nobody knows is we'll see a second 'golden era' and the universe reaches its 'big bang limit of elasticity' and begins to collapse in on itself and if that will even mean anything post 'heat death of the universe' which will inevitably happen as the elastic limit is approached. newlinechar  newlinechar Back of the envelope megaparsec localized, light travels roughly a billion kilometers per second while the universe travels outward at ~71km/s/mps.  The degenerate case is trying to get to a location on the opposite side of the big bang (assuming that the big bang was 'spherical'), which would double the 71km/s/mps.  That, of course, is ridiculous, so we're reduced to trying to figure out how fast we're separating from the narrowest conical slice of the sphere that houses planets capable of supporting life.

I get the meats on sale and freeze it until I make a gumbo. newlinechar  newlinechar The egg used to be a thing but a friend told me when I'm the only person he knows who still does it. That's how my maw-maw does it so that's what I do. My husband likes it. Just make enough to eat fresh. If you freeze your gumbo their texture gets funky. I like ramen so sometimes I use a soft boiled egg. newlinechar  newlinechar  Now my paran told me for Christmas a guy in the barge told him an OLD way of making was not using roux at all and using a bunch of really cooked down onions instead. That I have never heard of, neither has my family. Google and YouTube pulled up nothing support that claim, but I am intrigued enough to maybe try it on a small scale.

I'm not saying it can't be clarified. The guy didn't clarify with his original comment. He simply stated, 'that's not a blitz'.

Yes very much.

The depiction I was working with was from the hay-day of the Taliban in Afghanistan. From what I've seen of the Saudis, they don't hype the event, often meting out punishment upon a thoroughfare on the outskirts of the city with just a few witnesses. Myself? I'm of the 'there but for the grace of fate go I' philosophy. I feel kind of bad for people that fuck up so badly with their lives that they end up with 'life' or 'death row.' Not nearly as badly as I feel for victims of their crimes, mind you; but I'm thankful for the brain I've got and hopeful that it doesn't betray me my whole life.

Ethers are the coin for transacting on the ethereum network. Look into Proof of Stake (Casper is the name for the project).

In general, they are nominated before they died and then the committee awarded the prize before hearing about the recipient's death.
Well it’s good you know about this stuff, and you likely know more than I do. In that case, consider my comment to be a note to the types of people I mentioned, because they do exist. I happen to be new to a desert town that actually gets frequent snow in the winter (it’s fuckin weird I know). It absolutely blows my mind how many long-time locals own awd or 4wd and shrug off proper tires in the winter. Countless times, I have driven over stuff in my lowered fiesta with snow tires that trucks were stuck in feet away. This is me venting, but also showing that your average non car person doesn’t think about this stuff. They equate only the drivetrain to the capability of the car in certain road conditions, and do so with bald tires. 
Yup.  Seems to be a few days in a row that its sold off into evening.  Am hoping to pick some up in the 210-215 range.

Why? Just curious.  I don't really see my breasts as sexual anymore. I don't think I could breast feed and still feel like my breasts were sexual at the same time. My husband stays away during sex because they are so sensitive right now anyway. Hoping that goes back to normal when I'm done nursing. Since I don't see them as sexual I don't feel the need to censor my language about them. A breast or boob is the same as a hand, foot or arm. 
I think I learned it from Houston's own Mike Jones, come to think of it, so that makes sense. And with America's opioid epidemic this slang may be all the more in vogue. 
&gt; The reason therapists illegally go against confidentiality in these situations is because of the stigma. Therapists are human and many of them (even with their education) don’t think that there can be non-offending pedophiles. They report them out of fear and the idea of “protecting the children” when the person who sought therapy has never touched a child and sought therapy for the express purpose of never touching a child. newlinechar  newlinechar Again, that would be a problem with false empirical beliefs among therapists, not a problem with removing stigma in society. We can fix this by educating therapists with data showing that there can be non-offending pedophiles. Or we could even try to educate society at large that pedophilic desires does not entail pedophilic actions. But none of this requires removing the stigma against such desires. Stigma is the result of disapproving *attitudes*. But the problems you mention here are the result of false *beliefs*. We can remove the latter without removing the former. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; I don’t think otherwise non-pedophilic people are going to suddenly want to have sex with children if we remove the stigma. newlinechar  newlinechar How do you explain the increase in homosexuality and other non-traditional sexualities within the past few decades? It is implausible to suggest that this increase is not at least somewhat the result of decreased stigma for these sexualities. I see no reason why pedophilia would be different if we removed the stigma. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; The whole point is that stigma or no, these people exist. And we don’t know what causes them to have these feelings. Do you know why you are straight/gay/whatever? Do you remember the moment you decided to be that way? No. Because you didn’t decide. You just were. Just like no one is going to decide to be a pedophile just because we may remove the stigma for seeking treatment. newlinechar  newlinechar Of course, sexuality is not some mere conscious choice. But that doesn't men societal norms can't influence an individual's sexuality on a subconscious level. Again, see my example with other non-traditional sexualities above.

No, bloke. Discrimination against those who share harmless aspects with somebody else.

Well, kind of. Not all lumps in a breast are malignant or cancer. There are abscesses, fibroadenomas, lymph nodes, fatty tissues, etc. that you can occassionally feel. The problem is, even a trained physician can not tell you the difference by just feeling it. Until you are 40, unless you have a family history (or predetermined genetic disposition), it is almost always benign and a waste of time. The other issue is that mammogram itself isn't a perfect test and causes a lot of false positives. With each false positive, there are tons of follow-ups, biopsies, and a female + her family freaking out about possibly having cancer. There's no perfect answers, but the goal is to not do self exams to lower the burden on the medical industry and ease the anxiety for the females feeling the common lump or bump.  newlinechar  newlinechar That being said, ladies, if you ever see some change on the OUTSIDE of your breast, like nipple inverting, dimpling, bleeding, etc. see your physician. That is a tell-tale sign that something malignant may be ocurring.

Agreed, I'd say it's highly unlikely the Axiom was fitted with FTL even if the tech existed.  newlinechar We can apply some logic though... if FTL existed and the original plan (basically, stay on the Axiom until Earth is fixed) failed, then there would have been a contingency plan to get at least some of the population on a craft with FTL or retrofit FLT to the Axiom in order to get the population to a Earth type planet in order to give humanity a chance. 
**Promotion and relegation** newlinechar  newlinechar In sports leagues, promotion and relegation is a process where teams are transferred between multiple divisions based on their performance for the completed season. The best-ranked team(s) in the lower division are promoted to the higher division for the next season, and the worst-ranked team(s) in the higher division are relegated to the lower division for the next season. In some leagues, playoffs or qualifying rounds are also used to determine rankings. This process can continue through several levels of divisions, with teams being exchanged between levels 1 and 2, levels 2 and 3, levels 3 and 4, and so on. newlinechar  newlinechar *** newlinechar  newlinechar ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/steelers/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^] newlinechar ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28

I agree in principle but I really do think the important question is who carries out the execution and how we reconcile ourselves to living with them.

Black people's hair is (typically) kinkier and more conducive to the kind of braids required for a weave, and weaves/sew ins can also a protective style which is something that is more necessary for kinkier hair.

But that's kind of a chicken-and-egg situation.  I see people wondering why Excel is used and LO isn't used for entry level college engineering classes and econ classes.   Both of these classes use Excel because Solver gives easy and familiar access to an optimizer.   The fact the Solver is broken in LO Calc is likely the number one reason why it's not used for college econ classes and entry level engineering classes. newlinechar  newlinechar

Well first of they removed resistance and added adaptability (ADP for short). Instead of being pointless it now gives you bleed/poison bonuses as well as speeding up using items, like drinking estus. Since you seem to like melee I'll give you some of my favorite early weapons. 1. Rapier, a great weapon for the entire game. A certain combination of rings will make this weapon extremely potent, all tough it's still good without them.  newlinechar 2. Fire longsword, a pretty decent weapon overall. Excellent if you want to play as a pyro.  newlinechar 3.heide knight sword, personally I don't like the 1 hand move set but it's great for faith builds since it has lightning dmg and thus faith scaling.  newlinechar  newlinechar These two are obtained a bit later than the first 3 (they can be gotten in the first area) but they are really great for strength builds. 1. Greatsword, if you have watched/read berserk you'll get a Guts vibe from it.  newlinechar 2. The craftsman hammer, the first twinkling titanite weapon on the list and 3. The bandit axe. One of my new favorites. A great weapon for hybrids w a fairly low requirement of 18 str and 10 dex (I think). It has great base dmg and scaling so infusions are great for it.  newlinechar  newlinechar Also a heads up, pyro dmg scales w int/faith. There is also a new type of dmg, dark/hexes. These scale of your lowest out of int/faith but it gets a bigger bonus than things like strength.

I think a fair compromise would include: newlinechar  newlinechar * Removal of birthright citizenship (removes incentive) newlinechar * Creation of a national citizen ID (works as voter ID, ties in with Everify) newlinechar * Increasing amount of blue collar  workers (currently under EB3 visas) who can immigrate (currently very, very low).  newlinechar * Federal agencies can be more strict in deportation. There is less chance for racial profiling and error if every citizen has an ID proof of citizenship. newlinechar * Severe penalties for business who hire illegal labor. newlinechar  newlinechar EDIT: There was also a bipartisan attempt for comprehensive immigation reform :https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Security,_Economic_Opportunity,_and_Immigration_Modernization_Act_of_2013#Senate newlinechar  newlinechar It passed in the Senate, but the House chose not to go to conference on the bill, stating that border security was a higher priority. newlinechar  newlinechar I personally like the bill, since it compromises giving more options for those skilled and unskilled workers who wish to move to the US while providing for more border security. It also has a section for otherwise law-abiding undocumented/illegal immigrants to apply for legal status from within the U.S. (not really possible under the current system). newlinechar  newlinechar

Well kiddo, then you need to let it go. Easier said than done, I know. I suggest some comfort food, hanging out with other friends trying something new or different. You can’t make someone have feelings for you that they don’t. 
It’s not over though. Let’s see how it works in the long run 
If you say so
The graph showed an upward trend to the end and I went with the last year it showed. Not exactly a reach to say 'That isnt great when compared to the years before when it was half as much'. Also I completely dissagree with the sentiment of 'it was worse before, so its fine not improving now'.
That is the best thing someone has said Tonight.
Ok. So if he heard that and accepts it, you should not still be hearing 'because maybe I might want to have another' as reasoning from him. You do not want to have any more children, period. So go ahead and do whatever you need to do. If he wants to have another child, he is going to have figure out himself if he wants to leave and be with someone else who wants to have a child, or stay and accept not having any more children. But you do not need (nor should you) give up your autonomy in this situation. Having or not having kids is unfortunately one of those topics that I just don't believe you can really come to a compromise on. Either you are both on the same page, or you are not right for each other. I'm not saying you and your husband aren't right for each other, but you definitely need to make sure you position is crystal clear and do not waver on it. Then the ball is in his court.

It all depends on where you are and how far you're willing to travel. I've been at my current job for 15 years now, I'm the most senior guy on my shift, and as such, I'm also shift lead/supervisor/plant manager/machinist/programmer, and I don't make as much as you. Could I make more? Absolutely, but I'd have to drive an hour each way, and my time at home is already too limited with the hours we work. Any job I would be going to would work the same, if not more hours, so it's just not worth it to me to have to go that much farther away for a few dollars an hour. I work to live, I don't live to work.

The question was 'Can a person rationally believe that ‘no one has a right to my body without my consent’ while also believing that they have a right to a nonhuman animal’s body (particularly when not using an animal out of sheer desperation)?' To me, this question is essentially equating human and animal rights because it's framed as 'if you support x human right then why don't you support x as an animal right.'  newlinechar  newlinechar Yes, you have the right to kill and eat the pig. Why do you have that right? Because the pig is not guaranteed the right to life, and no law preventing the consumption of animal protein. A pig does not have the same right as a human and again you are implying that they do (or should) by stating by asking 'kill that pig when you have other options and then turn around and say that no one can come harm you when they have other options?' Why would I be subjected to what happened to the pig unless I and the pig had the same legal standing to life?  newlinechar  newlinechar Further, this raises the question that why would the pig only have a right to life if it was standing next to a healthy plant-based meal. If it was not, would you still be to you morally indefensible to slaughter and consume it?

I mainly just wanted a portable inverter. I work with commercial led installation and sometimes I may need to test the functionality of a fixture where I don't have access to power, like say on a pole light 30ft on a scissor lift that has no power because the timers or photocells haven't tripped them on. With this I can just plug the light directly into the inverter where I'm at to see if it works. A battery inverter has other uses though. Access to AC at around 50 watts can be useful in a power outage.  newlinechar  newlinechar As for the variable power supply aspect, there are many uses for that so long as you tinker with electronics. When it comes to flashlights and leds in particular, sometimes it's good to be able to tell at exactly what voltage an led will begin to illuminate for example. It also serves as a way to dim lighting. So if I wanted to I could hook any number of lighting modules with varying voltages to this thing and be able to drive it any at level from low to high just by adjusting the output voltage.   newlinechar  newlinechar I should have made a video but it was a spur of the moment project I only thought of taking pics of after completion. Either way just look at it like this:  You can buy 30v variable DC power supplies that can handle 5A at 30v for around $50 or so, and that's not bad.. but not everyone really needs that. The most I've ever done is charge a 24v battery bank with it (and now a 29v bank). Most people just need light troubleshooting capability and won't need to feed anything more than a few amps. In that case they might as well buy a $2 buck circuit and just add everything else themselves. newlinechar  newlinechar

He's just an OK QB that can't win a game when we need him to take over. newlinechar  newlinechar I hate to say it, but I think it's time to bring in a replacement, either in free agency or the draft.   newlinechar  newlinechar But, with the window of our defense being elite as maybe a few years, I'd bring in a more complete and competent QB in Free Agency.   newlinechar  newlinechar Go after Eli, or Alex Smith, or Cousins...   newlinechar  newlinechar We can be a SB team with a real QB under center.  Sorry to any BDB fan.  I'm not a hater on him, at least not anymore.  I just see him as an OK QB that can be a playoff contender, but he's not good enough to make us a SB contender.

No, and tbh gender studies degrees are pretty bogus. Usually it's a psychologist or a therapist that's worked with trans patients in the past and has spent a long time cultivating a knowledge of dealing with gender identity issues. newlinechar  newlinechar They don't convince the childen to 'maim' themselves. In fact, most of the time it's a dry and clinical diagnosis of the patient in question. Do they actually have gender identity issues or is it other body image issues? Would HRT or SRS actually help the patient or would it just be a bandaid for other issues that are mistaken for gender identity issues? Those kinds of things and those kind of questions. In my case, my parents had nothing to do with it and I'm sure 90% of the time that's the case as well. The parents you see doing horrible shit to their kids and parents horribly fucking up their kid's brains are a radical minority and they shouldn't be the image of the entire trans community at large.

It's better to broach the topic seriously, instead of casually mentioning it after sex. newlinechar  newlinechar I know it sounds tough, but slipping it into a compliment sandwich doesn't making it easier for him, it only makes it easier for *you*.

I'm telling you this because I care deeply about you, and I hope my sexual past won't affect the future of our wonderful relationship.' newlinechar  newlinechar ----- newlinechar At that point, it's on him to decide if your sexual history (which btw, I don't think is anything you should be ashamed about) is a dealbreaker for him, and it's on you to respect his choice. newlinechar  newlinechar As a side note, your friends sound pretty awful, texting each other behind your back about 'how much of a slut you used to be'.

Banks are not going out looking for customer deposits to then loan out as you seem to think. The Bank of England published a report that is quite clear on this. newlinechar  newlinechar If you have an asset such as a home worth $1m, and go to ask for a loan of $500,000, the bank does not check if they have $500k to lend you, they simply credit your account for $500k and 'create a deposit', the condition is that they can only create credit for a matching amount of collateral, which in this case is only 50% loan to value so easily covered. newlinechar  newlinechar From the customer perspective, your new asset created (the new bank account balance) is matched by a liability (the mortgage). From the banks side, the liability (bank account balance) is matched by the asset (your home). newlinechar  newlinechar The assets and liabilities all balance out to zero (disregarding interest). newlinechar  newlinechar Loans create deposits. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar

I'd say that he was constantly facing more hurdles than any other president based solely on the reason that he was black. Trump doesn't have America's interests at heart. He has corporations interests at heart. He's not looking out for America, he's selling America off little by little to the highest bidder. The rest of his party isn't worth a shit either. He's just another corporate puppet. His stances are based solely on the interests of corporations backing him. He's president because corrupt corporations and political campaign donors let him be.

As he grows to separate from his family, he doesn't just express Gryffindor pride, he needs to live and prove it - leading up to insulting and bullying Slytherins like Snape. newlinechar  newlinechar YES SO MUCH YES. Everything about Sirius comes down to rebelling against and living down his name. The only thing I might add to this point that differentiates him and Draco is that I get the distinct impression that Sirius's parents were not anywhere near as doting and loving a Draco's. I can't imagine Narcissa (or Lucius, really) ever talking to Draco like Walburga's portrait talks to Sirius or burning his name off of a wall. “Blood traitor, abomination, shame of my flesh!” is amusing at first, but so horrible when you imagine that's his *mother* saying that. I would guess that his initial dislike of his family comes from having distant, awful parents. newlinechar  newlinechar I also think the paragraph above has a good deal to do with why he clings to James (and James's beliefs) so utterly. James, with his worship of Gryffindor and the nobility and honor that comes from it, is everything his family is not. Not to say that Sirius does not come to genuinely believe that pureblood mania is BS, but it's got to come from somewhere, right? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Sirius clearly has a huge chip on his shoulder because of his family background. It's natural that Snape hates Sirius the most because Sirius has everything Snape wants - the family name, pureblood status, wealth, likeability - and Sirius throws it away. On the other hand, Sirius can't understand why Snape, who didn't grow up with the same crazy family (and knowing nothing of Snape's actual childhood) and who has a muggleborn friend, would buy into the pureblood mania to begin with. Sirius had to prove he was different from Snape and people like Snape. James did not. newlinechar  newlinechar This is so insightful. Thank you. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; I wouldn't be surprised if an adult James would have found himself siding with Lupin a lot more over Sirius in terms of letting bygones be bygones and growing up. newlinechar  newlinechar Oh yes, I can see this. I wouldn't actually be surprised if James at 21 would have also done so -- had they not been in hiding and in a terrible war situation. newlinechar

It's a bit out there for football but does the A-League go down the path of having a draft?

Of course, there'd have to be some compensation for the lower leagues as well bringing players through only to release them to the next level.
I realize that. I’ve seen her talk about her upbringing. That’s not really why I don’t like her on the show though. You can be cold and still be entertaining.

She’ll talk Erika Jayne all day but she won’t discuss anything that really interests viewers. Like I’ve said in another comment it’s all just my opinion.

Na not really I guess it was like everything combined. Well I always posted on topic but then kind of derailed from it altogether, started rambling about stuff that wasn't really important. Like responded to someone asking 'why do you think X player is doing badly this season' and then from there going on to talk about the whole team in specifics. newlinechar  newlinechar And then at some point might have mentioned something like that vaguely and that was it.  newlinechar  newlinechar I mean it should be obvious for the people who frequent the sub daily when something's *off*, so I don't think it ever really needed saying, but I've tried to avoid it as much as possible. I've had people asking me 'whether I'm on adderall' and stuff like that but what am I supposed to say? I haven't responded but there have been times when I have or brought it up myself. newlinechar  newlinechar The ban comes when you drift from the main topic completely.. Okay there are probably exceptions but it's understandable when it comes to stuff like this, which is why it's not worth doing. I mean it has never been like I've been trying to brag or something.. What's there to brag about? A sober person looks at a few posts as long as essays and makes his own conclusions. Just saying, you what I mean? newlinechar  newlinechar Just for the sake of it I also gotta add that my intention has never been to advocate stuff like that, they're bad. But most of the people here are old enough to realize it for themselves. In the end it's your body but you also gotta think how it affects the others. I'm not saying this to look good or anything, it's just what I think and a fact really.

Your DH clearly told you that he doesn't have a plan to protect you or your child from his mother. That means you have to make a plan, and it just include as a contingency, what your plan is if he endangers you and your child by sharing information or allowing contact with his mother. I strongly suggest you actually type it up and tape it where he can see it. It will also be comforting to have a plan.  newlinechar  newlinechar For example:  newlinechar  newlinechar MIL shows up at the door: begin recording. Verbally tell her to leave. If she refuses, call the police and tell them 'a mentally disturbed woman with a history of addiction and violence against me is refusing to leave my door.

Not crazy money, but decent), who is much better at planning and executing that plan, and this problem would not have existed.
I don't think the accent is the problem, I think British singers of today who sing in those accents are just genuinely terrible who are probably forcing it to add some form of personality to their music, otherwise it wouldn't have any. Lily Allen is a good example,Scouting For Girls and Kaiser Chiefs are another. However, I can think of some examples of good ones, Charlie Fink from Noah and the Whale for instance. He does twinge to American sometimes, but for the most part he's from the midlands and it's a hard accent to shake, so it comes through, especially in 5 Years Time.

Well there are about 3.6 billion options for a straight male. probably 1-2 billion of those are asian, stop worrying about the ethnicity and just focus on the girls personality and developing a close friendship with the person you date in the future.  newlinechar  newlinechar I read some of your previous posts and I understand you have autism, bear in mind that advice you get in the internet isn't going to be as helpful as advice you'll get from people who know you, your family and friends.  newlinechar  newlinechar It's important for you to realise that nobody is going to conform fully to what you want in a relationship, this is why personality is the most important facet of any relationship, without compatible personalities it won't work in the long run no matter how hard you try or try to conform to what she wants in a relationship... This is true irrespective of ethnicity. If you find asian girls attractive and want to pursue them thats perfectly fine but you shouldn't pursue a particular girl for the sole reason that she is asian, you should evaluate how well you get on, how compatible you two are and how much she likes you also.

It's a nightmare, frankly, no matter what position you're in with it. newlinechar  newlinechar I think what frustrates me the most is how many times I repeat the same conversation over and over trying to explain it to the other side. I would say cis, but people not comfortable with the lingos seem to think it's an insult, instead of simply meaning you've never sat there and seriously debated if you would be happier as the other sex. newlinechar  newlinechar Because to most people in the Navy, trans just means you're mentally unstable because you want different genitalia. They think we don't serve well or are even capable of serving well because for those of us who haven't transitioned or aren't in the process, we couldn't possibly be trans, so they have no qualms openly espousing their view point on how we shouldn't be allowed to serve to us when they consider us friends and it never enters their heads that they may be throwing blanket judgements on the very person they're speaking to. newlinechar  newlinechar But I do serve. I've served eight years and four deployments and I like to think I'm reasonably good at it. I know I'm certainly committed to doing the best I can at it, and I cannot say that I've had a smooth run so far. But we tough it out. newlinechar  newlinechar In ways, having the option makes it both better and worse, because (and I know I'm strange for this) I really do believe in this institution, in the Navy. Not that it's perfect, or even great, but that it has the potential to be great, to be a positive example for the rest of the world, and I very much want to be a part of making that happen. newlinechar  newlinechar I've had to choose between that and my frustration with having to check 'F' in the box, and it's a frustration I've been dealing with for over ten years now. Not only that, but now I'm losing friends over it, simply because they can't level my being a hard charger with tits over my genuine wish that I didn't have them. newlinechar  newlinechar It doesn't make me any different than the person they already know. It doesn't make me less capable. It just means I wish I didn't have tits, something that- by instruction- I, and not the military, was always going to have to pay for. But somehow that's a personal affront, and no one can explain to me why.

So in your view we should abolish all education, and let doctors be qualified based on what? Their assurance that they spent enough time self-teaching in a library that they know how to fix you without killing you? newlinechar  newlinechar There are two major problems with your view that I see. newlinechar  newlinechar The first is that not everyone learns in the way you describe. You're describing an extremely self-motivated person. Those sorts of people are not the majority. There are plenty of people who want to learn, but have trouble when given so little direction and oversight. There are also those who think they'd rather not learn anything, but find their lives vastly improved by having done so. Add to this that we would most likely be talking about children, and the amount of self-motivated learners goes down even more. How would children be taught to read or do arithmetic if they were left to their own devices? Surely they would choose to play instead? newlinechar  newlinechar But perhaps by education, you mean secondary or post secondary education, which brings me to my second point. Without an education system with certain standards, the necessary experts don't come with the guarantees that they should. If Doctors are left to self-learn, there's a good chance they'll miss something important. If Architects are left to self-learn, then the building they design may collapse and kill people. It's important that our experts know what they're doing, important enough that we as a community should ensure it.
I don't know why you're conflating what I'm saying with what other people were saying before those fights and then calling it revisionist history That's a major fallacy. I've been consistent about Eddie being an extremely weak champ. I was saying that before he got his shit pushed in by McGregor. He looked like dogshit against Pettis and Melendez and barely scrapped past them in the most underwhelming of performances. I'm not holding the one fight against him but I'm certainly not extrapolating that he's on Khabib on Ferguson's level because he beat up Eddie Alvarez. It's one data point. newlinechar  newlinechar Frankly, I regard his fights against Diaz as data points as well. I don't really care that Nate was blown up and fighting with a soft midsection. You do realize that Nate missed weight by 5 pounds when he fought RDA at LW right? He looked exactly like he did against Conor and Dos Anjos kicked his ass effortlessly. Conor on the other hand lost to him on 11 days notice after prepping for a title fight and then scraped past him in the a majority decision. At the end of the day, Nate was a blown-up lightweight.  newlinechar  newlinechar To say, McGregor is as good as Khabib and Ferguson based on the above is crazy to me.

There are a lot of houses out there right now that have no garage at all, or no driveway, or an otherwise similar situation.

Lenin was possibly the one with the closest understanding of objective histpory and the structure of the USSR was so fashioned. Which is why it stayed true to the core logic of Communist Manifesto even as Mao was quickly unravelling the 'Chinese Revolution' to set up shop for Walmart. BUT. Scientific socialists are not pedantic. We can for example see the value in Trump as an agent for progress even though many would not agree (I am not a Tortskyite. I am not anything other than a scientist). On that basis, I would actively push for Trump not because any of these delusional liberals still carry Lenins mantle but only because they are delusional fools who will land us in trouble if they are not kept away from power till they learn. And Islam is the riskiest issue they cannot be entrusted with.

If you lose over half of the energy you make, that means you burn over twice as much fuel. More fuel burnt, more green house gases. So, no, they are not as sound as they can possibly get. 40% thermal efficiency is only the absolute latest and greatest. Most cars average 20% efficiency.

Yeah, but realistically, it's not about the value of the dollar as much as it is about the relative value of income vs. cost of living, which appears to allow even low income families here to have a higher quality of life on what we consider minimum wage. We also seem to have better systems in place for things like welfare and healthcare (although our welfare system is not great lately - they started automating big chunks of it which assigned people huge undeserved debts, which isn't great especially considering it was targetting those in need) - however, I'm not super educated on the US equivalents and I haven't lived through them, so I'm not sure what the pros/cons are comparatively except anecdotally. Even if you account for the dollar value difference or whatever, it's undeniable that being able to see a doctor or have government support while you search for a job, or welfare rent assistance (which low income families are often eligible for here), is a HUGE factor in how a low income family can budget for themselves. Taking that into account, $12,000 here can be very different from $12,000 there, even if you allow for exchange rates. newlinechar  newlinechar Besides, our minimum wage for a full time job at 38 hours per week is $36k/year before tax. After tax, that becomes $32k/year. Accounting for the current exchange rate, that becomes roughly $25k/year after tax in USD. newlinechar So having a minimum wage that's half of that in a super power first-world country seems pretty fucked up to me. newlinechar  newlinechar I mean, shit, I grew up in a family with a single widowed parent who also had a terminal illness and was unable to work at all and 3 siblings, and with supplementary income from me when I was a teenager (which still left me with enough pocket cash to spend on little treats for myself here and there), I still feel like my family grew up in less poverty than some of the stories I hear about low income families in the US.
That is absolutely what happened.

I’m not knocking the gains, but the “wraith protocol” or whatever they’re calling it now is something that many other coins already do. In terms of privacy and security it doesn’t begin to compare with XMR and other cryptonight currencies.  newlinechar  newlinechar Also, Mcafee. If you see Mcafee associated with a coin, avoid that coin. If you have any doubts, read up on Mcafee. He’s insane, the last I heard about him was that he was holed up in some compound in South America and was wanted for murder? Something like that. The man is cancer for the cryptocurrency markets, real investors love him because his endorsement makes picking investments easier, just avoid him and research the others. 
Warframe was far from a complete product 4 years back it even had its beta tag up for well over a year and look at how far its has come. so far most F2P games lose players because they add BS in there cash shops that drive apart the community and so far Dauntless has not done such a thing the games only ben open 4 months and has gone though its fair share up updates with a progression system overhaul. MH Is a AAA title with years of predecessors to draw from. Dauntless is in the same space yeah but dauntless could look a hell of alot different in a year or two and it will live or die buy the passion developers and its community. Any way Destiny was Competing with warframe back in the day and look were D2 is at now bungi is fucking it up with subpar DLC and Bad micro transactions

So WoW started declining after its first expansion is what you're saying? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;You'd roll into an area with your alt and find that guy that was ganking you, and you take your vengeance. newlinechar  newlinechar How has that changed? I literally had to do this, a month ago while levelling. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; You can't be blacklisted for ninja looting. newlinechar  newlinechar Oh ok, so is that a perk you look for in an MMO? on the back of the box: You can ninja loot!. What MMO offers that nowadays? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Now leveling is mindless. Nobody knows you. You can't be blacklisted for ninja looting. You don't run into other raid parties and break out in war. You don't have PVP groups recognized and feared. There is no travel, just menus. newlinechar  newlinechar Levelling becomes a smaller part of the game in a theme park MMO, that is a given that every theme park suffers because of flaws in its design. That can't be helped.  newlinechar  newlinechar So you don't every see raid groups forming outside a raid instance after 2006? That seems silly. Theres still plenty of travel, and like I said, look at the other big subscription MMO, FFXIV, where you're literally able to teleport to every zone in the game, that doesnt seem to affect their game or community. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;The reason people want vanilla, and miss old WoW isn't because of 'the cool new boss'. And wanting access to it. They miss it because so many interactions and experiences are now gone from the game because of the changes they made. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't mind people missing or wanting Vanilla, but a lot of these changes are absolutely inevitable to stay competitive in the genre. Otherwise this discussion we'd be talking about WoW dying because they never adapted or changed to the needs of the changing playerbase. newlinechar  newlinechar The same things you're complaining about what has changed in WoW, other MMOs have been doing absolutely fantastic doing the same decisions. Meanwhile other games that cling onto those old ways? 
&gt;XRP is bad for crypto newlinechar  newlinechar Yeah Ripple is evil because it's actually being used to solve a problem in one of the largest industries in the world.

We all know the block chain was developed to track K:D on an immutable ledger or another 'privacy' coin that is just a BTC clone with Tor.

Eh, Section 8 is similar but a little different in that landlords generally have to fight tooth and nail to get any kind of reimbursement for damages to property that Sec 8 tenants do. Landlords do, however, have to perform prompt repairs to keep everything up to standard if there's an issue with the property that, legally, the landlord is responsible for. newlinechar  newlinechar I have seen cases like you describe--where tenants have torn doors off (and worse)--where landlords just had to eat the cost of replacing those doors because HUD refused to reimburse. HUD also tends to undervalue rentals: the market value on the apartment that I live in is in the $1200/mo range but if my apartments accepted Sec 8, HUD wouldn't pay more than $800-900 (I get a discount due to being a disabled veteran, but that's a choice the company that owns and manages the property has made). Also, HUD properties in many cities here tend to be crime-ridden and in bad neighborhoods, and properties in 'good' neighborhoods deliberately do not accept HUD as a selling point. newlinechar  newlinechar Many properties do not accept HUD vouchers/stopped accepting HUD vouchers because of the undervaluing and damage to property that HUD does not reimburse. I used to manage several properties for a friend and he stopped accepting HUD for this reason: only received 2/3 (at best) of market value and could not make tenants pay for damage to property, nor could he get HUD to reimburse him for damage that their tenants did. newlinechar  newlinechar Personally, sometimes I think the UK system might be better than the clusterfuck we have here.

As much as riding is a solo activity, there's no way to maintain or adjust bikes without talking to people, going on YouTube, going on forums, downloading manuals, etc.  newlinechar  newlinechar You can buy a Honda Civic and drive it work every day and never know how it works.

AMC has the Stubs program, they have a free program that gives very little points (don't remember specifics but pretty terrible), if you pay $15 a year you get the Premium status, which means every $50 you spend on anything, you get $5 reward you can use for a ticket purchase, concessions, or anything else they may sell. You can buy anything at concessions with points, whereas Regal is only popcorn or soda. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't have Cinemark so cannot comment on them. newlinechar  newlinechar As for gaining points at concessions - I don't think either program will limit you at concessions - you pay with your own money there, so the cashiers will not see your MoviePass card, thus there should not be any objection to earning points via concession purchases. Only if some other program started a 'ConcessionsPass' that you weren't paying your own money for. newlinechar 
Yes. But generally when you pay in cash you're seeing and touching your product. If I buy your couch off Craigslist for cash, I can touch it and smell it and make sure I actually physically have it. If you physically take my money and steal the couch, I can report you to the local cops with a description of you and shit.   newlinechar  newlinechar If a merchant takes your XRB and *poofs*, you have no recourse. Especially if they're in another country. 'OK your shipment will be delivered in 4-5 business days!' - you check in 8 days and it isn't there. You go to their website and it's just gone. Checkmate.   newlinechar  newlinechar It's like paying with cash if you had to trust people you've never seen to give you stuff you've never seen with your cash. I'd trust Amazon, but maybe not Etsy.   newlinechar  newlinechar I don't believe Rai can make smart contracts for this service, either. I will have to look into it more. If not, we just need an abstraction layer on top of this to ensure that smart contracts are possible, or that there is recourse for fraudulent merchants.   newlinechar  newlinechar It just needs time. Until then, some trust will be involved. I like it.

Every game is a must win. The fact that he hasn't personally somehow found a way to squeeze out a few more wins here and there doesn't prevent him from being elite. The fact that he has over 4000 yards and 25 tds in each of the last 3 seasons makes him one of the best QBs in the league right now, and the best QB that the Redskins have had in my lifetime (I'm 37). If he's making more money than you think he should, blame the front office for jerking him around. But as for reasons why this team isn't in the playoffs, Cousins is just about at the bottom of my list.

It's not so much as equalizing as it is density manipulation, basically compressing atoms (Pym says it changes atomic relative distance) to become so dense. newlinechar  newlinechar Not sure, but my guess is Scott temporarily accumulates mass when he grows giant by taking in the molecules around him (air molecules for instance) and the blue Pym Particles somehow makes his body bond with these at the same time it changes atomic relative distance between the particles making up his body, creating a stable proportion. The suit protects Scott from losing molecular integrity or something. newlinechar  newlinechar That's why he says in Civil War that he passes out after he goes giant: he expels these extra molecules he had accumulated earlier. In the Avengers Assemble cartoon, he says he passes out, but it's shown he 'drools' after (he denies this first when T'Challa asks, because he was embarrassed anyone would find out his drooling problem), in the comics, he says he throws up after, so there is basis that MCU Scott also is prone to throwing up after. newlinechar  newlinechar But I think the bigger question is that when he becomes small, his mass is inconsistent. His body becomes super dense, but Conservation of Mass should mean he doesn't lose mass. newlinechar  newlinechar It's no wonder why no one could work out the formula-- Pym must have found several important scientific breakthroughs to get there. No wonder he's so secretive about it. newlinechar  newlinechar TL;DR: Pym Particles, How do they Work?
awesome :D

You put your finger on something interesting.  Writers who kill characters off for impact often find that the audience walls itself off from caring too much for the characters in the first place.   Because we're reasonably sure that the heroes won't die,  we can afford to invest emotionally in them and care about what happens to them, how they feel about it and what they do next.

This one happened to be a 9 year just like the standard sib. Lukas received three 9 year barrel samples and this one was the fav. I hope they get some older store pick barrels eventually!
Oh, I know. I'm free to play, and it was just heart-breaking to see rainbow aura with Sara and Kana breaking the stone on the last step, only to get the second Velvet instead of an awakening unit. I really wish they'd fix those tells in the initial pull animation, because I think that one was the one that hurt the most.
Shibuya has one of the largest NYE celebrations in the world. Every single bar and club in and around Shibuya throws a party for the new year. What the fuck are you talking about?
&gt; I think for (non-housing) investment you can only claim deductions on income earned from the actual investment. newlinechar  newlinechar Not quite true. newlinechar  newlinechar I had an investment account a few years ago. Any interest charged on the money used to fund the investment account was able to be used as a tax deduction (Looking at the tax return, seems to be in the order of 30%) newlinechar  newlinechar So theoretically, I could borrow money from the bank to fund an investment in bitcoin. IIRC, the borrowing would need to be classed as an investment loan, and not simply be money taken from an existing non-investment loan. Any interest charged by the bank on the money I borrowed could be claimed as a tax deduction. I would then typically be hit with CGT when I cashed in the bitcoins. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: I'm pretty sure there are numerous rules about what you can and cant invest in to be able to claim deductions, but its definitely not limited to housing investment.
I mean, if they wanted to stop smurfing, aren't there more effective ways? Like to play competitive, an account would need a registered email/phone number? newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar If someone wants to smurf there isn't much stopping them. This might allow them to 'get to the rank they belong' faster, but what's going to stop them from just making a new smurf and doing it again and again? I don't think the problem is how long smurfs stay at lower ranks, I think the problem is the intent to smurf at all.
I will paraphrase what I saw someone said to me ' Iron is forged in the heart of a sun, so you can't hurt it go nuts' newlinechar  newlinechar You can make all the mistakes and you wont hurt that pan. It can get rusty, you can screw up the seasoning, you could use it to bash open a hole in the wall and then cook bacon on it. Basically as long as you dont fill your sink with icy water heat the pan up then dunk it a few times you are golden.  newlinechar  newlinechar Go buy a pound of bacon, and go nuts man. Just make sure you take lots of pictures so we can cheer your nonkosher success or guide you away from what made your failure. (PS the failure is unlikely)
I'd say the chairs were more violent. The cage fall wa more spectacular, but it wasn't anywhere near as brutal as multiple chair shots were. They still try and do spots off the cage. No one is allowed to do chair shots like that anymore in the WWE.

She laughed and said 'I'm down'. Don't think she realizes how many sets of lips that is.

I agree Lady Pede.  It would be much more difficult to sexually assault you in a safety zone.  Praise Allah
Fuck those mayonnaise eating, flaming thumb tacks!! 
Your parents had 3 spare rooms and they made you and the bro bunk together? Who hurt them?
Andy Green the ultimate cincy player? 
Happy New Year from Norway!
Thank you! Hehe
Seriously. They just want to pretend theyre experts on something because they saw it in a movie.  If she was cutting off their tails or something,  yah. But unintentionally giving them something bad thinking she was helping then immediately feeling like shit and paying to right the situation has 0 case. Animal control doesnt deal with this.  Im not suing someone that doesnt need to be sued. She knows now not to feed anyones pet anything without their permission... expecially exotics. I have a bunch of different dinos and each kind needs a very very specialized diet. 
for sure, wallets are the top priority now that exchanges are rolling in

Okay
Normally there will be a gun nearby, and in any case you can never have too much of either ammo.

Best of luck, I look forward to cursing at you for years to come.
