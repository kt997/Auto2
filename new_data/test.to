Why the fuck would you sit Cooks for Dede? Cooks is a top 12 WR for fantasy scoring, while Dede has had like 3 acceptable games this year. And the Pats needed the win to secure home field and were playing the shitty Jets.
Not going for a field goal on 2nd down with plenty of time while down by more than 7 would be a start.
I completely agree. And his base is dwindling by the minute. To be frank, most of them were just caught up in the excitement of the election.

And the point I'm making is that it's due to subject distance, not focal length / telephoto lenses.  Again, you should actually read the article.  The perceived distance between them is because they are further away from the camera than they are from each other.  Look at the posts in the background of the 'wide' shot and you can see the same effect occurring. newlinechar  newlinechar The camera is 1.5 million km from the moon, the moon is only 384 thousand from the earth, this large subject distance is what results in the 'compression', the focal length is only zooming in on a relationship that already exists physically between the viewpoint, foreground, and background object.

Hey i main an orc shammy too! The class is really fun, whether you‚Äôre healing or damaging. Yeah the beginner quests are rather straightforward and don‚Äôt demand too much out of you.

When you get to higher levels though there‚Äôll be a central hub for an area that includes an overarching story for your class and character.

You shouldn‚Äôt have an issue hitting 1080p 60fps in most games with that setup. Some older games you‚Äôd probably hit a bit higher than that.

Honestly, Intel is actually better for gaming. Ryzen is a bit cheaper though.

I see a whole variety of issues with that approach. Firstly, how much of a nation is needed to form the 'allowed to overthrow our ruler' entity? Every single individual besides the ruler? 95%? Simple majority? Seems completely arbitrary whichever you choose. newlinechar  newlinechar Secondly, the ruler is in authority over the nation, even if the whole nation doesn't like it (practically speaking, if everyone doesn't like it the ruler won't be in authority anymore anyway. Rulers need some means of carrying out their will beyond mere 'I'm the captain now'). The nation doesn't have some God-given authority to overthrow their ruler. The Reformers' view that lesser magistrates could overthrow higher magistrates who broke the law is far more useful and defensible.  newlinechar  newlinechar Thirdly, the ruler may be obligated to keep the law of God, but that doesn't give 'the nation' the authority to overthrow him when he doesn't. It may give the lesser magistrate authority, but not 'the nation'. I don't know of anywhere in the Bible where the concept of the nation having a single identity and authority over its rulers exists.

I think the exception, if any such exception exists, would be in finding a cycle that's different to 4-2-1. It's been proved that if such a cycle exists, it must be [pretty damn big](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture#Cycles), but yeah: as far as I can see, the whole constant-growing thing is *probably* a dead end. newlinechar  newlinechar EDIT: OK, right... that makes more sense. The issue isn't that the numbers grow forever -- that much is impossible, as you rightly point out -- but that *sets* of numbers might grow forever. Say you have an odd number *x*, so you do your 3n+1, and you're left with an even number which you then divide by 2 to get your number *y*. If *y* is odd, it will grow again if you put it through the same process to get a new number *z*, and so on, and so on. In only becomes a smaller number if the new number is divisible by 4. *In theory*, I can't see a reason why these cycles of numbers couldn't keep getting bigger forever, which is why it's not a complete dead end. It would be a jagged upward line, but it would still be a line that trended upwards forever, if that makes sense. Trying to find a different loop (other than 4-2-1) feels like it would be more fruitful, though.

If your monthly rent is $850, then your yearly rent is $10,200.

Compatibilists deny this because they don't think determinism is a constraint, and incompatibilists deny this because they deny determinism. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Well that goes back to the case of metaphysical libertarianism but honestly that raises more questions than it answers because it requires that the events in the brain that lead to the performance of actions do not have an entirely physical explanation, and consequently the world is not closed under physics. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof and for that claim the burden of proof might be just too heavy. newlinechar  newlinechar I would humbly submit that you are in absolutely no position to be passing judgment on the merits of incompatibilism or any other position in the free will debate, because you haven't even gotten clear on the basics of the debate, let alone extensively studied the various alternatives in order to be able to make an informed judgment. Right now you're in the position of someone who thinks that weather might be caused by the gods being angry at us who is passing judgment on a cutting edge claim about global warming made by a climate scientist. Even if we could get this person to agree that weather is not caused by the gods, it's going to take a lot of learning before we think they're anywhere near the point where they can pass judgment on what cutting edge climate science has to say.

Well the reason I bought this car (2018 Toyota 4Runner) was because itd be my car up until I have kids. I figured I‚Äôd pay this off now and then I won‚Äôt have to worry about anything.

Yes and no. A run game helps keep the LBs at bay, which allows more time in the pocket, which creates a higher competition percentage. When the offense has to essentially use short lateral throws to mitigate pressure, the passing percentage and passing yards get inflated, while the offense is actually less effective

I do notice that a lot of INTPs prefer strategy and RPG games. It kind of feels weird for me because I often find myself bored of these types of games really quickly. That doesn't mean that I don't enjoy these types of games, in fact, some of the games that I like include the fallout series, Cities Skylines, Prison Architect, and the Civilization series. I just feel like they don't captivate my attention for long periods of time. I don't know if I'm alone here, but I tend to prefer skill-based games.

No one truly know how SR works behind the hood. We can make educated guesses, but its hard to actually test those hypothesis.  newlinechar  newlinechar Many people believe that playing a low-pick hero improve your SR gains if you can actually perform well on them because there is less data on how well those heroes should perform. Yet, you don't see solid data that confirm that. No one made a (eg) Mei-only account, then a Tracer-only account, noted down all the end-of-game data of each map, and compared them with the amount of SR change after each match.  newlinechar  newlinechar So, IMO, you should use Blizzard guidelines: Play your best/favorite heroes, switch if you think a different hero would be better to either beat the enemy formation or synergize with your team, always play to win, and trust that your teammates are also doing their best to win as well.

It was actually incredibly straight forward. I snipped the leads that ran to the internal speaker and the leads going to the vertical and horizontal deflection coils.

But when I was diagnosed about 4 years ago, my GI (who is super amazing) told me not to freak out about things that weren‚Äôt going in my mouth like shampoo and nail polish and whatnot, and to only really worry about the gluten-freeness of products (other than food ofc) like toothpaste and lipstick. newlinechar Of course it doesn‚Äôt hurt to be extra safe when it comes to anything going on your body, but it can honestly drive you insane to have to investigate everything you come into contact with.  newlinechar So if you wanna look up this stuff for peace of mind I don‚Äôt blame ya, but I wouldn‚Äôt stress too much about it.

Notice the word Revenue.  Cutting revenue increases the deficit.  Republicans know this because they set the tax cuts to expire to get around rules that state they can't increase the deficit after a 10 year window.  Also, there is nothing socially liberal about Trump.  Not on the environment, not on police brutality, not on abortion.  We heard that before the election and every appointment he has made has shown that to be bullshit.  He has so poisoned the well that there is no incentive for Democrats to cooperate with him on anything.    
I strongly dislike the poppy sound. Instrumentation is generic. Vocals are too produced.

Sowell calls it the cracker culture.

This culture came, in turn, from the 'Cracker culture' of the North Britons and Scots-Irish who migrated from the generally lawless border regions of Britain. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Sowell gives a number of examples that he regards as supporting the lineage, e.g., newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; an aversion to work, proneness to violence, neglect of education, sexual promiscuity, improvidence, drunkenness, lack of entrepreneurship,‚Ä¶ and a style of religious oratory marked by strident rhetoric, unbridled emotions, and flamboyant imagery.[1]
They also had to go on: the caller said the house was 1 story, and the one they came to was 2 stories.

If officers aren't wondering if it's real, well, obviously they fucking need to. What do I expect the officer to do?

I think of it as the 'Fafnir syndrome' where after transforming you feel like you're less tanky, I think it has to do with your model becoming bigger and easier to see in teamfights(and generally when you're transforming you're in the middle of the fight) so it's harder to juke/hide. newlinechar  newlinechar Glad shield is more noticeable in the small 1v1 or 1v2 fights not in the bigger lategame scenarios, it gives a fake illusion of having really good sustain but you still have to play carefully and not dive in without having a good build.
You can trade skins, use them and collect them. Also you‚Äôre associating the level of interactivity with the enjoyment someone gets from them which might be true for you but isn‚Äôt for everyone and that doesn‚Äôt make them wrong.

It was legit a while ago. Then tech came to San Francisco and the housing market got hot, hot enough to attract rampant foreign investment from China. This made the average rent go up several hundred percent very, very quickly, and stay on that trend for several years. This caused the middle class to bail either to the burbs or other west coast cities. newlinechar  newlinechar I think most of this applies to Seattle as well, and Portland being stuck between the two caught the brunt of 'poor' San Franciscians and Seattleites blowing up their housing market. All of this made a great environment for a ton of both wandering and native homeless across the board, which brings drugs and all the usual shit along with it. newlinechar  newlinechar Long story short, I'd move back to my hometown of Denver tomorrow but the home prices are up over double what they were in even the 7-8 years since I left.

Even if a gamer pirates a game which they had no intent to pay for, and shares knowledge about the game with other gamers, it's a loss for the developer because having access to paid content for free sets a precedent that discourages other potential buyers from buying the game if there is a way that they can get it for free. newlinechar  newlinechar You may argue that piracy has no major effect on sales numbers, but piracy, in its most basic form, is and always will be stealing. You are taking paid content, which holds value, for free. A paid game is an asset with value in it. If gamer A purchases a game, while gamer B pirates a game for free, gamer B now owns an asset that was worth X dollars that gamer A paid for. The fact that you try to justify and defend people stealing these games 'just because it happens on a small scale' is despicable.

&gt;So an ancap who wants to attempt to create an equal society by implementing capitalism newlinechar  newlinechar Anarcho-capitalism is a contradiction in terms. Anarchism is a rejection of hierarchical leadership and authority in social relationships. Capitalism, on the other hand, requires the existence of dominant and subordinate classes. For capital to be accumulated, the working class must be exploited and oppressed by the owning class, as Marx rigorously demonstrates over hundreds of pages in the volumes of *Capital*. Capitalism requires a hierarchical division of labor and classes. Moreover, all of the 'intellectuals' associated with anarcho-capitalism understand anarchy not as a condition in which there is no hierarchical authority, but rather a condition in which there is simply no state to regulate capitalism or to interfere in the accumulation of capital. Thinkers from Rothbard to Hoppe to Nozick all openly *embrace* what they understand as inherent inequality between people and all argue that domination of the weak by the strong is the natural state of things and is an expression of anarchy in that there is no government or state to intervene in this natural order of things.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;And a syndicalist who wants to try and climb the socialist corporate ladder through his own work is a right winger? newlinechar  newlinechar Why would a society in which property is held in common have a hierarchical corporate ladder? For Marx, socialism is the negation of capital and the existing division of labor. Additionally, as Bordiga observed, the hell of capitalism is the firm itself. A socialist society is not going to retain the corporate hierarchy as a means of organizing production. You have no understanding of what capitalism or socialism or anarchism even are, stop pretending like you're some kind of intellectual authority here.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;At its core, Left-wing means anti-private property and Right-wing means pro-private property. newlinechar  newlinechar And yet, there are strains of leftism such as mutualism that are pro-private property and forms of fascism that want all property to be national property.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Unless you aren't a marxist of course. newlinechar  newlinechar I am a Marxist, and I am *categorically* telling you that you have absolutely no understanding of Marxism, or, frankly, political theory in general.

No, that advice is wrong. You want to split them over the channels so as to maintain dual channel operation. However, fully populating the slots might mean that you can't get to 3200 speeds. newlinechar  newlinechar You want them like this newlinechar  newlinechar Slot | Channel  | DIMM newlinechar ---|---|--- newlinechar A1 | A | 8 GB newlinechar A2 | A | 4 GB newlinechar B1 | B | 8 GB newlinechar B2 | B | 4 GB newlinechar  newlinechar So that both A and B both have 12GB in them, for a total of 24GB.  newlinechar  newlinechar If you put 16GB in A, and 8GB in B, then you would have dual channel for 16GB, and 8GB in single channel operation, rather than 24GB in dual channel.

&gt; I referenced this already. If there's an issue with therapists reporting clients for pedophilia, then that's a reason for working to improve confidentiality in therapy sessions. But that doesn't mean we should remove the stigma from society at large. newlinechar  newlinechar The reason therapists illegally go against confidentiality in these situations is because of the stigma. Therapists are human and many of them (even with their education) don‚Äôt think that there can be non-offending pedophiles. They report them out of fear and the idea of ‚Äúprotecting the children‚Äù when the person who sought therapy has never touched a child and sought therapy for the express purpose of never touching a child.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; I‚Äôm saying removing the stigma against pedophilia will make it socially acceptable and thus more common. If pedophilia is more common, then pedophilic acts  be more common as well. Of course, this is making the assumption that if there are more people with a desire to do X, then more people will do X (which seems to be a valid assumption to me). newlinechar  newlinechar And this is where we disagree. I don‚Äôt think otherwise non-pedophilic people are going to suddenly want to have sex with children if we remove the stigma. newlinechar  newlinechar The whole point is that stigma or no, these people exist. And we don‚Äôt know what causes them to have these feelings. Do you know why you are straight/gay/whatever? Do you remember the moment you decided to be that way? No. Because you didn‚Äôt decide. You just were. Just like no one is going to decide to be a pedophile just because we may remove the stigma for seeking treatment.  newlinechar  newlinechar Read *The Other Side Of Desire* by Daniel Bergner.

&gt; The funny thing is that you are likely supporting the FBI's and deep states' attempted coup to take down Trump. newlinechar  newlinechar And what makes you say that? Listen, nothing is absolute. 'Deep state' isn't some official club that has taken over 100% of the American government. The government is made up of the people. Trump isn't above the law, nor is he above answering to the American people. We need to get away from this 'my team' is always right no matter what and everyone else is the enemy.  Different people have different motivations. I don't know Trump personally. Do I trust him more than Clinton? Probably, but the real goal is to have our system set up so we don't *need* to trust these people. That's why there is a little thing called the United States Constitution. It specifically limits power as appropriate. We just need to get back to following it. newlinechar  newlinechar Trump needs to let the system work. That's his biggest problem. He thinks he's somehow above everything. He's not. It's fine to not lie down and take it when people come after you, but Trump acts like he's right 100% of the time and can't ever be faulted by anyone. The man isn't a god. He's not faultless. He needs to stop being so defensive and forceful. All he's doing is ensuring he doesn't get re-elected. People are watching everything, they're paying attention to politics now, which is good. Trump needs to stay focused on his strengths and stop picking fights with every single person because when he does that he weakens his own hand. That's nothing to do with any conspiracy take down. That's Trump himself. newlinechar

The two issues were that your bowl had very high nitrates (this is a carcinogen generated from their waste) that lowered your fish's lifespan and their overall health. The second is that betta fish (like most fish) will get bored/stressed if their environment doesn't have enough stimulation. Usually this is accomplished with sufficient plants or decorations in a large enough tank. If you were missing a filter/heater, that would compound the issues even more and would mean you had nitrites in your tank, which is far more toxic than nitrates. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm not saying it isn't possible for the fish to live a few years in shitty conditions, I'm just saying that it's an abusive and difficult condition to leave the fish under. Head over to either /r/aquariums or /r/bettafish where people get pretty serious about minimum living conditions for bettas.

My reaction when a girl breaks up with me but says she still wants to be friends 
Same, I don't know anyone who got pissed off regarding this, and I'm glad for that. newlinechar  newlinechar I will tell a little story though: The only thing that pissed me off the night Bin Laden was killed was that everyone was shouting and going nuts. I was in my senior year of college, and I could hear the shouting through my concrete dorm walls. All I wanted to do was finish my thesis paper... Hard to do when the whole world around you feels like it's shouting. newlinechar  newlinechar My exchange student friends were also caught off guard by it, they all thought it was really scary that everyone was running around and screaming. If I was in their shoes I'd have no idea what was happening! newlinechar  newlinechar So that's kinda the taste that night left in my mouth- People shouting 'America' and going nuts, friends getting scared, and overall a sense that while this was certainly a milestone in the war on terror, it wasn't anywhere close to the end... If an end even exists. More of a sobering night for me than anything else.
&gt; If anything ellison's the idiot for offering such a cushy job to someone with no background/credentials, so the critique should be with his decisionmaking and how unlikely it is someone in his position would realistically make that kind of offer (or give karen so much leeway at work). newlinechar  newlinechar That's the sort of decision where HR would more than likely have to vet Karen through a background check, resume, and references and all that good shit before even considering her for a cubicle in the newsroom.

&gt;You are misunderstanding what I‚Äôm saying, my man.

I still hold this is unverifived and total horse crap **until** you can provide a source. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I‚Äôm just trying to help you understand this newlinechar  newlinechar If this is your idea of help you should stop. You're trying (and failing btw) to mislead people with your own unverified version of a study you clearly do not have the expertise to criticize meaningfully. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Many think that if you find correlation and a causal relationship seems reasonable, that you can assume you‚Äôve found causation newlinechar  newlinechar Yeah, this a long winded way of saying 'correlation doesn't mean causation' and considering the paper **does not say correlation, causation or even casual**. I can safely say you are lying about the content of the paper itself. It's piss take that you call yourself an statistician and you're hand waving a massive paper about statistics on the basis of a set of words that were never mentioned in the paper. newlinechar  newlinechar This is an embarrassment if you are actually a statistician. If you actually work in a profession on basis of that expertise you should do the honest and right thing right now and quit because you are not qualified in the slightest to be one and literally stealing from your employer  newlinechar   newlinechar &gt;that you can assume you‚Äôve found causation - but it can‚Äôt be proven and therefore a study claiming to find such a conclusion is bunk newlinechar  newlinechar Let the record show that a self proclaimed 'statistician' is saying it's impossible to prove any relationship ever. newlinechar  newlinechar Again, it seems you didn't actually read the paper. You're simply lying about the paper and being dishonest.

Wentz is gone, offense struggled against an Oakland team that couldn't hold onto the ball for more than a minute for their lives, and the defense struggled earlier against the Rams and almost gave up 30 to the Giants.

&gt; I'm childfree, but I want a long-term partner.

Not a friend dealbreaker, but a dating dealbreaker. He is not really interested in real relationships or connecting with someone. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar My main goal is to find a long-term partner but I don't have a particular timetable for that happening. I'm not opposed to casual dating, but my preference would be if I do casually date I'd want it to be with people who are at least open to the possibility of a relationship evolving into something long term. I'm specifically NOT seeking short term hookups (though I wouldn't be surprised if that ends up happening inadvertently if I get ghosted after sleeping with someone one or two times).  newlinechar  newlinechar I'm currently on the fence about whether to have children, but increasingly leaning toward not having them as I get older. If I matched with a woman who was certain she did not want to have children I would be OK with that (and after getting married I'd be willing to get a vasectomy if need be).  newlinechar  newlinechar Likewise if I matched with a woman who was on the fence or who expressed an interest in having a child, just not on a short timetable, I'd be fine with that as well. I'd want to have a few pressure-free years together, then if we made a mutual decision to have kids, have some lead time to prepare (to the extent one can prepare) by doing things like taking parenting classes, babysitting for friends etc.  Just about the only realistic way this scenario could play out is if I find someone younger than my age. But while I'm open to that as a possibility it's not a requirement.  newlinechar  newlinechar Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be a way for someone whose preferences similar to mine (prefers LTR but open to casual, on the fence about kids, not picky about age) to communicate them without other people suspecting they're lying about their intentions or seeking hookups.

&gt;Hijra is a term given to¬†eunuchs,¬†intersex¬†people, and¬†transgender¬†people in¬†South Asia.¬†They are also known as¬†Aravani,¬†Aruvani¬†or¬†Jagappa.¬†In many languages of India, especially outside North-West India, other terms are used such as¬†chhakka. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Hijras¬†are officially recognized as¬†third gender¬†in South Asian countries,¬†being considered neither completely male nor female. Hijras have a recorded history in the¬†Indian subcontinent¬†from antiquity onwards as suggested by the¬†Kama Sutraperiod. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Many¬†hijras¬†live in well-defined and organised all-hijracommunities, led by a¬†guru.¬†These communities have sustained themselves over generations by 'adopting' boys who are in abject poverty, rejected by, or flee, their family of origin.¬†Many work as¬†sex workers¬†for survival. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;The word 'hijra' is a¬†Hindi-Urdu¬†word,¬†derived from the¬†Semitic Arabic root¬†hjr¬†in its sense of 'leaving one's tribe'.¬†The Indian usage has traditionally been translated into English as 'eunuch' or 'hermaphrodite', where 'the irregularity of the male genitalia is central to the definition.'¬†However, in general hijras are born male, only a few having been born with¬†intersex¬†variations.¬†Some Hijras undergo an initiation rite into the hijra community called nirwaan, which refers to the¬†removal of the penis, scrotum and testicles. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Since the late 20th century, some hijra activists and Western¬†non-government organizations¬†(NGOs) have¬†lobbied¬†for official recognition of the hijra as a kind of 'third sex' or 'third gender', as neither man nor woman.¬†Hijras have successfully gained this recognition in Bangladesh and are eligible for priority in education.¬†In India, the¬†Supreme Court¬†in April 2014 recognised hijra and¬†transgender,¬†eunuchs,¬†intersex¬†people as a 'third gender' in law. Nepal, Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh have all legally accepted the existence of a third gender, with India including an option for them on¬†passports¬†and certain official documents. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Most hijras live at the margins of society with very low status; the very word 'hijra' is sometimes used in a derogatory manner. The Indian lawyer and author Rajesh Talwar has written a book highlighting the human rights abuses suffered by the community titled 'The Third Sex and Human Rights.'¬†Few employment opportunities are available to hijras. Many get their income from extortion (forced payment by disrupting work/life using demonstrations and interference), performing at ceremonies (toli), begging (dheengna), or¬†sex work('raarha')‚Äîan occupation of eunuchs also recorded in premodern times. Violence against hijras, especially hijra sex workers, is often brutal, and occurs in public spaces, police stations, prisons, and their homes. As with¬†transgender¬†people in most of the world, they face extreme discrimination in health, housing, education, employment, immigration, law, and any bureaucracy that is unable to place them into male or female gender categories. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;In 2008, HIV prevalence was 27.6% amongst hijra sex workers in¬†Larkana, Pakistan.¬†The general prevalence of HIV among the adult Pakistani population is estimated at 0.1%. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;In October 2013, Pakistani Christians and Muslims (Shia and Sunni) put pressure on the landlords of Imamia Colony to evict any¬†transgender¬†residents. 'Generally in Pakistan, Khwaja Sira are not under threat. But they are in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province because of a 'new Islam' under way', I.A. Rehman, the director of the¬†Human Rights Commission of Pakistan. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;In a study of Bangladeshi hijras, participants reported not being allowed to seek healthcare at the private chambers of doctors, and experiencing abuse if they go to government hospitals. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Beginning in 2006, hijras were engaged to accompany¬†Patna¬†city revenue officials to collect unpaid taxes, receiving a 4-percent commission. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Since India's Supreme Court re-criminalized homosexual sex on 13 December 2013, there has been a sharp increase in the physical, psychological and sexual violence against the¬†transgendercommunity by the¬†Indian Police Service, nor are they investigating even when sexual assault against them is reported. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;On 15 April 2014, in¬†National Legal Services Authority v. Union of India, the¬†Supreme Court of India¬†ruled that transgender people should be treated as a third category of gender or as a¬†socially and economically 'backward' class¬†entitled to proportional access and representation in education and jobs. newlinechar  newlinechar https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijra_(South_Asia)

Yeah I encountered the DNS setting while debugging someone else's Java program that had to be sure to handle very short TTLs. I've had to deal with a lot of Java *software* in production so you pick up a few things and opinions along the way as a result. newlinechar  newlinechar That's why I'm asking questions, I want to understand the language better than I do now. I'm not discounting that Java can be a good tool to use but it's sometimes used in places it was not designed for, it's a general purpose language but that does not mean it can or should solve any particular problem, and I want to better my own understanding so I'm not as biased when debates come up. There's no substitute for learning this through experience but when you're not using a language on a daily basis you're often better off asking questions instead of continuing to rely on your own assumptions.
I don't think he is worth a top 5 pick especially with all our teams holes I will take a RB in round 2 and have a better fit that has more of an impact. It's not that I hate Barkley but with a rookie QB I don't want to be behind the chains often, he has a great ability to break big plays but he also has quite a few plays where he gets nothing or does to much and loses yards. He is similar to David Johnson and he will get his big plays but personally I would rather have Guice or one of the second round guys

Assuming we really are the 3rd best defense, and that's not just because it is averaged with the earlier part of the season.... newlinechar A #3 defense in any particular year does not fit an Empire image.  The 2016 defense wasn't just #1 for a year, but a once in 20 years kind of defense.  In just 6 years, Alabama put out 3 defenses that could be considered contenders for 'Once in a lifetime' status. newlinechar  newlinechar Anyway, we are in a very different state right now.  Against Mississippi State, we looked less physical than Vanderbilt.  Against Auburn, probably due to a freshman signal caller, it seemed we couldn't disguise or surprise. It seemed that the only time we could stop the 3rd down crossing routes was when we had a timeout and Pruitt was able to prepare the play.  In the last two real games, we have been playing off our backfoot, with no real threat of disrupting the QB. newlinechar  newlinechar Of course, we get a whole new combination of linebackers against Clemson, so maybe we will look better, but I wouldn't bet on it.  People give us the benefit of the doubt because we are Alabama, but I think that in the years where we've had fatal flaws such as lack of depth or experience at certain positions, Saban's coaching magic was not able to mask it, as people seem to keep assuming it will.

You could definitely say that, since film critics consistently rank the OT higher than the prequels, and film critics are thought to be the highest authority on film quality, that that would be the final word on it. It's definitely a good piece of supporting evidence. newlinechar  newlinechar However, critics can have different criteria and can even make claims that are baffling to us normals. For example, art critics often consider this to be one of the best painting of all time: newlinechar  newlinechar https://www.jackson-pollock.org/images/paintings/convergence.jpg newlinechar  newlinechar Is it? Obviously art is up to individual interpretation, but I know a lot of people that would find some major disagreements with that painting.

Absolutely understood. I really hope the best outcome in this search.  newlinechar  newlinechar The ARCHER system was a setup aboard the CAP Gippsland GA-8 aircraft that had a high spectrum digital camera, laptop for image analysis, and an Iridium phone system to send emails down to base in near-real-time. We got one of the first planes with the system to check out and it worked way better than we would have assumed. It was great because it would take a Google Earth type image and put a big red blotch on the image where something didn‚Äôt belong. It aided in scanning for an object more than a team of aircraft. But I don‚Äôt know what ever happened to the system. That was in ~2002/2003 and I‚Äôve been told all the GA-8s are gone now. 
At least make an attempt to read my other replies
I am not even worried about either of those teams tbh. Jaguars are at a 7 and Steelers are at a 6 in terms of concern. All others are less than 4

Here is another way to think about it as well. Nassib who should be a rotational player is a starter on this team. Not by his choice but because the roster isn't complete and injuries. newlinechar  newlinechar These guys give it their all and you can see it in CoCo's eyes. He wasn't the one who told Sashi to pick him at 15. What he did is didn't know a route tree his rookie year to teaching other WRs the route tree his sophomore year. newlinechar  newlinechar Yes the fans deserve more than what we have gotten for 19 years but the players are giving 100%. You can't ask for more.

Idk, I keep hearing on Fox News that the Iranians are the baddies and Fox is usually a good source for news. /s newlinechar  newlinechar My statement still stands.

Just look at the lad damn. That would be ideal. I am saying I'd rather him be blissfully acceptant of his fat(like as if he didn't even know it was bad) than live a life of struggle and shame trying to lose his fat when he has obviously failed. Yes, I don't care that he doesn't live up to social norms and such as well. If the man has accepted death, like all good saints and Scot Catholics should, then he probably is happy. Good for him. Longevity is not everything.
Dollars? Probably around that. But any other effect (besides Bubbling, Aces, DP, etc.) and the price jumps WAY higher. Slap on something like Miami Nights or similar effects and its worth $200+. That's all I was saying. Don't think too much about what-ifs though, just enjoy the unusual!

In my oppinion, its because you had a happy, loving, great, relationship up untill that point, so what changed where its suddenly more important to have a big rock than to be with your loving partner? Where as with sex it creates problems in the relationship by making one or both parties stressed, pressured, and misserable which will lead to fights that can and will eventually breed resentment and ruin the relationship anyway. newlinechar  newlinechar Here, the gf was (as far as we know atleast) perfectly happy in the relationship for years without a big, shiny, overpriced rock, theres no reason for that to change now.

It's three Organs, one in the brain that has most of the Primarch-ness to it, one behind the third lung that can just dump them full of combat stims and super-helaing juice if they take catastrophic damage (the justification for the second wound, I assume), and the third is more technological, being steel reinforcement cabling woven through their muscles. None of them requires the other organs to function (and the third you probably can't put in until just before the Black Carapace anyways, otherwise the marine will outgrow it and you'd have to go back again). So while there's probably a standard order they're implanted in during a scout's regular progressing through the ranks, there shouldn't be any reason you couldn't implant them all after the fact.

I'll run the idea of dissociation by my therapist at my next session. I had made a note of that earlier in life, I couldn't remember anything specific about the last 3-4 years of my life. Just kind of slipped in and out, but with huge gaps where I felt like time passed, but couldn't tell you what happened. I could pass a test on if something was true or false, but I couldn't lay out the events themselves without just confirming a timeline already written for me. newlinechar  newlinechar And sometimes I'll realize that I'm 'in real life', so to speak? Like I'll be at work and then realize that I'm a human in control of a body, and it'll give me a pause, maybe a bit of a start, and then I just go back to feeling 'normal' again, which is usually just me thinking about stuff while on autopilot physically. newlinechar  newlinechar The terms I use for my past life, future life, etc, is mostly ceremonial. I know it's my life, and that I'm one person with different descriptors. I just don't feel comfortable being referred to as either just yet.

They'd torture me under the guise of curiosity/concern/love and make things worse. I live with my father right now taking care of him, and I'm paying rent and utilities... actually I guess at this point he lives with *me*. He's very much of the alt-right persuasion, and as soon as he can stand on his own financially (see: gets his disability) he's promised to pay me back what I've given him. We'll see if that happens. newlinechar  newlinechar When I don't have to deal with guilt of leaving him by himself, I'll bail and just never speak to my family or friends ever again, probably. My friends, a couple I've come out to. I already only talk to them once every now and then. They seem supportive but they're very much uncomfortable with the whole idea. I wouldn't lose anything by leaving them. newlinechar  newlinechar That'd be a perfect scenario, but I can't get a job if I start transitioning, and I can promise that if I turn 30 and I've not gotten HRT figured out, the only passing I'll be doing is passing *on*. newlinechar  newlinechar But there's no reason why I can't get that sorted. It's only a whole day's trip and four months of savings to get started on HRT, assuming I only need one visit initially.

Good discussion. Bitcoin runs on the ‚Äòworlds-computer‚Äô and is arguably more easily transferable (as opposed to perhaps holding physical gold blocks). It can also be divided into smaller or equal portions digitally and can be accessed from a somewhat decentralized network. It may also be used as your own, personal bank, from which you can add or subtract funds rather easily. This is why I am excited about the possibilities of the lightning network as it provides users with the ability to transfer funds between a savings/checking account type of system without having to rely on a third party.

They don't need passports to travel between countries so why should they. newlinechar  newlinechar **Interesting the last time I was in Amsterdam, the locals were more annoyed by drunk working-class Brits than Americans.  I'm not sure why people think that some rural white working class type who votes UKIP in Britain or for the National Front in France has a passport.  They probably are very similar to the working class types in America.  This is basically snobbish neo-liberal Europeans shaming the US with inaccurate information.

Too many bad situations have happened from just saying no and/or trying to leave. :( 
&gt;Okay, obviously this isn't true, but come on, if you found out that only one women ever made your boyfriend cum and that actually it wasn't just a 'him' issue but something she apparently had/did that you don't, are you telling me that wouldn't hurt like hell newlinechar  newlinechar Fun story: I've been through something like this.   I dated someone who had an extremely hard time orgasming during sex, especially with new partners.   He had only a handful of girlfriends before me and had only successfully reached climax via PIV intercourse with his first.  newlinechar  newlinechar Now, I was 30 and not 22 (**edit:** and I've had plenty of experience with different partners) but it didn't bother me a bit.   We took our time.   I got him off in other ways.  I didn't make it about me.  I didn't guilt him.  And, wouldn't you know, after 6 months he started coming with the strength and punctuality of a freight train (TMI?)  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I mean, even not in the girlfriend's shoes, I'm wondering what the deal is. It's very unusual to be able to orgasm normally with one person and then never again with 20+ other people. newlinechar  newlinechar It's actually not.  A lot of guys go off like a rocket during their first handful of sexual encounters.   For near-virgins, sex is novel and inherently super exciting.   That may wear off.  newlinechar  newlinechar Guys don't always come easily during sex.   It doesn't make them broken.    newlinechar  newlinechar

I agree wholeheartedly! There are very few movie characters that are hated by (nearly) all, generally thanks to a superb actor/actress.
A 20 is a 20 
&gt;They WERE bad a Japan, Phy adult gohan sucks  newlinechar  newlinechar Again, the quality still doesn't matter, they are still exclusives.  And, what are you talking about with PHY Adult Gohan?  There is no PHY Adult Gohan that's exclusive to JPN...The only Gohan currently exclusive to JPN is LR Gohan, and we're not talking about him, we're talking about units that should have been out on GBL by now but aren't.   newlinechar  newlinechar And, again Yes, most of the exclusives are bad NOW. They weren't when they launched on JPN and when they should have launched on Global. Releasing them now, yes, they're useless. That's still kind of the problem, and it's the problem with the Battlefield units. Global missed out on units back when those units were useful.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Also why would they NOT bring battlefield to global, they are working on it and you have no proof that they are not coming out  newlinechar  newlinechar Why would they not give Tiencha to GBL?  Why would they delay INT Trunks' dokkan for so long?  Bamco's proven time and time again that they don't make sense.  But, yes, you're right, I have no proof that Battlefield isn't coming to Global, just like you have no proof that it is coming to Global.  Either way, it doesn't matter, because, again, the original point is that Japan has gotten this gamemode long long long before Global and Global should have had it launch by now.  Even if it came out tomorrow, it would still be months later that it should have come out.  Ergo, that's a shaft.   newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;And to the stones, one person does count stones given on global, and usually it‚Äôs at least 100 stones a month If your going to disprove me with stones, show actual evidence  newlinechar  newlinechar I like how you only said someone counts on Global but didn't mention how many stones JPN gets...I can gather actual evidence, but it'll take about a month, in the meantime, some basic logic will have to suffice.  That being that if Japan gets more stones from celebrations (for example, Japan gets 5 stones on Christmas day, Global gets 1.  Japan gets 50 stones for first login of the Christmas Celebration, Global got 10. ect), and if Japan gets stones every week for Dragon Ball Super but Global doesn't, that would kind of indicate that Japan gets more stones than Global.  If one version gets more stones overall than the other from various celebrations and just every week and everything else is the same...then that means that one version gets more stones than the other overall... newlinechar  newlinechar If you want an example right here right now, take a look at the New Years login celebrations between the two versions.  JPN gets 55 stones total.  Global gets 39.

Thanks. The list is definitely interesting. Personally I really don't like the 4 mainboard meddling mages, and as a whole the list strikes me as somewhat disjointed.

If you look at it like a stoneforge deck, its strange because delver adds aggro elements to it. Idk, it just feels like there's a lot of tension in this list instead of cohesion. newlinechar  newlinechar If you are open to checking out a similar list, check out this Esper Deathblade list that took second at Eternal weekend. The pilot is a scumbag for multiple reasons which i'm not getting into on reddit, but the list is very cool.

Naw they wouldn't just go extinct. There would be wayyy less of them, but they wouldn't all die out.

Does it make sense to be concerned with an animal going extinct... and then kill millions of them every year? Wouldn't it make more sense to do what we do for every other animal that we want to save from extinction? Ya know, help breed and protect them in sanctuaries with the intention of reintroducing them into the wild in some capacity? Farm animals aren't a part of an ecosystem, so if they disappeared from farms entirely there really wouldn't be any negative repercussions. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't avoid eating cows because I want to pet them, I do it because I don't want to hurt them if I don't have to.

&gt;An external cost is still a cost in fact, and when imposed on society it represents a subsidy. You can't just pretend that the cost of fossil fuels exists in a vacuum - that is playing make-believe to suit the argument. newlinechar  newlinechar ok, in that case renewables loose hard because the materials for them are strip mined in China, which does incredible amounts of damage to the local environment.

Yes i have forgotten that.It has 2 use cases: newlinechar  newlinechar - shielding against ulting enemys newlinechar - taking the battery/sattelite uplink more or less save. newlinechar  newlinechar But a super ability which is only usefull in 2 very specific cases and makes the gameplay worse, while using it in almost all other cases is just a bad super overall to have in the game. newlinechar  newlinechar  The whole design of uplink and overcharge just does not work in a fast paced game like this one. Those 2 modes are just bad/lazy constructed versions of a flagrun type gamemode. This whole idea of charging up the object in one small room leeds only to the entire team camping in this small room for most of the round instead of spreading out more over the map and gaining mapcontroll,which would promote cool fights over different areas of the map. They have basicaly created 3 gamemodes which reward camping on one spot for most of the round heavily and thats never a good thing in a game which values fast paced movement so much.  newlinechar  newlinechar They just need to go back onto the drawing board with at least those 3 modes (uplink,overcharge and occupy).Blitzball could also use some changes, so that they can finaly get rid of juggernaughts shield ability and replace it with something cool which promotes more active play and counterplay instead of static camping.

You don‚Äôt have to make a Bamco account, but if you‚Äôre on iOS you just have to uninstall the game. Make sure to save your primary account if you haven‚Äôt.

I used Nox for faster rerolling, which you can delete a data file that deletes the account and let‚Äôs you start over without downloading anything. On iPhones it takes about 10 minutes per reroll, Nox is less than 5. If you can just delete the player data, like on Nox, there‚Äôs a trick where you can turn on auto for both walking and battling to make it and it‚Äôll save the settings for any future rerolling accounts, which makes it a lot lazier and easier.

As much as I would enjoy that, that sounds like it would be super strenuous on development resources. Frankly, I'd rather have them both remade separately with the love and attention to detail they each deserve than together sharing so much content with only one dev team. It's like saying that Gaiden and Shadow Dragon should've shared a remake. It would be great if they were released separate and maybe bundled together later like the Metroid Prime Trilogy, or the Metal Gear Solid HD Collection with connective features? Idk, I just think that when we get Binding Blade in the west and when Blazing Blade gets updated they shouldn't be half-assed.

Nah. I personally think it's just monkey biting behavior but with a human twist. Men hate women because we are lower on the hierarchical totem. They abuse women instead of the men above them. They find extra satisfaction in harming 'beautiful' women because they sit higher on the female totem. So it's 'extra' power to harm highly desirable women. It's like being rich enough to be able to throw away an outfit after one use. It's a show of power.

Mobility is kind of a big deal when a large amount of official maps are asymmetrical and favor the generalist classes. newlinechar  newlinechar Spy is significantly more risky than Sniper. If a single person manages to see you (or even just knows there's a Spy on your team), you may as well just hit your kill bind and swap class. Either the entire team starts spychecking which forces you to give up, or you end up dying because someone turned around. newlinechar  newlinechar But with Sniper, it's not like that. You can still do well as a Sniper even if the enemy knows you have one. Sniper is harder to counter by nature. The element of surprise is currently Spy's main advantage, and I think the sheer danger of being a Spy is already enough of a downside. He doesn't need to be slow at setting up, too. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't see how a speed buff while cloaked would be a bad idea *if it were implemented correctly*. I can understand that if it were implemented poorly it could be a disaster, but that doesn't have to be the case. newlinechar  newlinechar I suggest making the speed buff only apply when the Spy is completely invisible. Any blinking (from damage or bumping into enemies) would cause the Spy to run at stock speed until he turns invisible again. This would reward the players who can avoid being hit but punishes the players who can't.

Yes I've been monitoring the algorithm as it runs for about 2 weeks now.

My worry is trying to determine Fiat value at the level of each trade from an altcoin. Altcoins don't have a pairing with USD, so I have to convert to BTC first. What I don't understand is which conversion rate to use. If I'm buying the altcoin on an exchange which is undervaluing the altcoin, do I use the conversion rate I got there, which was not market value, or am I supposed to use a market aggregate? 
It's a few degrees above freezing where I live, it's fine if you bundle up.

Too much work putting stabilizer in the fuel and hooking up a battery tender and all that crap - no thanks, I'll ride it every day, it only snows a week or two out of the year where I live, it's not freaking North Dakota or something.

There‚Äôs a difference between being hopeful in the offseason for your team (aka being a fan) and shitting on everything your team does when they‚Äôre in a rebuild/transition phase because they‚Äôre not winning 10 games a year. newlinechar  newlinechar I just don‚Äôt understand the need to be so toxic. If you look at a lot of the moves Pace has made objectively, he‚Äôs been pretty decent. He‚Äôs drafted well (biggest thing in a rebuild) and made some good moves in Free Agency. He‚Äôs also made some very bad moves in Free Agency and has some misses in the draft. Guess what? So does literally every other GM in the league. We have a solid foundational core of players going forward, are an overall young team with no big deadweight contracts that will drag us down going forward. We‚Äôre really not in a bad spot. People like OP make it seem so much worse than it is. I get it, he is tired of seeing a losing team but winning in this league is hard and Pace has generally been doing the right thing in setting up this team to start making a push the next few years (mostly hinges on Trubisky to be fair). newlinechar  newlinechar

Hey, man.  I'm glad you enjoy it!  It's always great to hear when someone appreciates the work! newlinechar  newlinechar Aside from a couple one-off renders of individual ships, this is my first time really doing something with an isometric perspective.  As much as I'd like to give an isometric take on the main chart a shot, it would be a huge ordeal; basically the equivalent of starting the main chart over from scratch.  I'm not going to totally rule out the possibility, but don't hold your breath waiting for me to do it. newlinechar  newlinechar What I will say is that I *am* currently looking into doing an isometric render set to complement my top-down orthographic ones.  If I do so, I'll be sure to make the renders available for people to use, whether I make a chart with them or not.  Don't hold me to making the renders, though!  I'm still undecided.

UKIP aren't far right. They only got 1.9% in the last election (2017). And even in 2015 they only got 1 seat, not 2. They currently have 0 seats. If you count 1.9% at a national election and 0 seats as a major party then fair enough though

There's plenty of reason to believe a bank would continue bad behaviour by being bailed out, but that's nothing to do with prolonging a recession.  newlinechar  newlinechar Are you aware that a recession is two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth?

If i'm remembering right it was last year when Arizona and Seattle played each other, the game was tied up and went into overtime, Hauschka missed a field goal, and then with no time left Catanzaro was brought on to kick the game winning field goal, he ended up hitting the upright as time expired and the game ended in a 6-6 OT tie. It was described as the best-worst game of the year in here by a /r/NFL user. This was Pete Carrolls reaction to the ARZ missed FG attempt. I picked this up almost immediately after and have made use of it a few times over the past year.

Our secondary needs massive improvements this off-season, hopefully both in FA and the draft.  Going into this season we knew the secondary would be a huge weakness, and it was.

He has been a successful DC in the league for a long time, so I'll trust him over my limited knowledge.  He was literally given a roster with no FS, and then the FO released one of his best CBs, what was he supposed to do?

Hey neighbour!

I have a huge personal problem with reapers. They are like godmode stealth build master sergeant shinobis from lw2 right from the get-go. The one tile detection radius is broken and unrealistic and I even despise the graphical design. Some more futuristic chameleon-inspired armour with much shorter coat, to reduce noise would look more in-universe appropriate and also offer some explanation to the basically invisible stealth.  newlinechar  newlinechar Skirmishers have one of the best action economies in the game but rather bad damage. The second level of ripjack is their saving grace with that sweet guaranteed stun. Based on the aforementioned playthrough, the hero classes suffer from lack of scaling in reliable damage since their weapons aren't their main source of damage output. This was most notable in skirmishers, since rend is just godlike ability with parry and scout-build reapers don't rely on damage that much. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: I a word
Watch how clean the first punch that dropped Eddie landed. A clean left hand right on the point of the chin with Eddie inexplicably looking the other way. I think he was slightly hurt from that for the reminder of the round so the other knockdowns aren't a big surprise, imo. Then Conor put him away with a 3-punch combo. Poirier didn't land as clean at any point but he still hurt Eddie badly later on.  newlinechar  newlinechar I agree that Conor hits harder than Dustin but I don't think he's presents the danger of a 1-punch KO or agree with this talk of a guaranteed KO if Khabib keeps it on the feet for longer than 2 seconds.

Taking clones of people's consciousness into a digital reality for the purpose of torturing them, along with questions about morality over the torture of a digital intelligence. If you strip away the shallow Star Trek parody, it's really not very different (other than being muddied by plot holes and terrible comedy). It's admittedly also quite similar to the Star Trek TOS episode The Squire of Gothos, where a godlike alien takes the crew captive for the purpose of essentially playing with them as toys.
I think it‚Äôs something they would do however I haven‚Äôt seen them do it. Hence the citation, which you still haven‚Äôt provided.

Well, we won't know for certain either way til it comes to an end.  The biggest differences here compared to Libya are that the protesters are primarily anti-theocracy, and *everyone* involved is Shi'a (or potentially atheist/other religions) rather than Sunni.
Please wear it every time they play.
&gt; I know people on here say that Lowbo works off Deathstroke teams but I play PVP all the time and I have never seen this. newlinechar  newlinechar I've seen situations where you are forced to attack a Lowbo. Say, if you didn't have the dps to burst down Deathstroke by turn 2, then Lowbo taunts. Or maybe Lowbo attacked your HQ/CotA and got counter-killed. He revives with taunt and because your team is geared (faster) they keep HAVING to shoot Lowbo (usually with one shots) causing death-taunt loops. Hooray, Derpstroke can now one shot your G11 Cupes &gt;_&lt;; newlinechar  newlinechar Maybe you have the perfect counter teams, but a lot of people don't have the roster to deal with this. Point being, there is tangible proof that NOT gearing Lobo can be a super viable option. It's oddly counter-intuitive to the rest of this game and suuuuucks so bad.

1. Why is there something instead of nothing? The answer is: we don't know.

I wouldn't mind Isane. I already have SS Nemu but, I didn't even max her Soul Tree. Didn't really take to her, but I'll definitely 200 Isane. She has some nice gameplay. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm pretty sure my spirit person is Byakuya. Everytime he is around, I pull him. Maxed out my TT Byakuya on my previous account, and got him yet again on this one. Plus, got his LA version twice on my previous account, and now 3 times here. Can't forget Last Years Step-Ups. Got 4 OG Byakuya. Also got his TYBW on his separate banner. Lol. Byakuya loves me. newlinechar  newlinechar Somewhere around 2.5K. I still have to max Yachiru, I still have some side story left to max out and some characters along with some main story and the Co-Op Orbs. However with the New Years Quest here, I'm also trying to farm as much as I can for tickets and such. So Maybe around 2.5K I'll have for her... I really hope that'll be enough. TYBW Toshiro &amp; BYakuya's individual banners bled my luck dry (Got Toshiro on 9th single, and Byakuya on 14th single) and Senna (First multi on double chance). I wasn't hopeful for this banner. Would have been satisfied with just Unohana or Uryuu since he has evaded me since his release. newlinechar  newlinechar Thank you! *May RNGesus bless us with Unohana*. newlinechar  newlinechar

I really disagree. He had a down year this year, for sure. Last year wasn't as good either (better than this year). But remember that since Hayward left and Shields got injured HHCD has not had a lot of time to be a traditional safety because the corners have needed so much help or the SS has been an extra linebacker in Nitro. Do not be surprised at all if he rebounds to form next year with a new scheme and reinforcements in the secondary.
No. I've done that, but you need to get rid of that.

I went back and looked at the passing stats for the past 5 years that the guy above me brought up.

I _think_, idk but I _think_ that the whole idea with the story is to explore the boundaries of horror. In essence, to replace a monster/ghost/killer clown with something even more basic in the psyche: disgust. I heard an interview with a social scientist (I believe) who was explaining their work on this topic, that disgust is much easier to study than horror or trauma, etc., because it is an immediate and visceral reaction, unable to be hidden. This story certainly tapped into that, for me, at least. Trapped in a port-a-potty of doom? yep, that would be my nightmare. Oh, and King threw in in-operable cancer, for good measure, as well, just in case that wasn't enough. newlinechar  newlinechar I remember reading on this sub a while back people talking about words they could not abide, with _moist_ coming out a clear un-favorite. So, everybody has their button; this story pressed mine. If it didn't press yours, maybe you are the lucky one :)

Sidious would still have needed to install himself in the republic and form the Empire if he wasnt Palpatine. There are a few ways it could have been done, but I kinda like the 'hiding in plain sight' plot they took with Sidious. He was literally there, the whole time, and they didnt realize how big of a threat he was until it was too late.

Once the owners get their TV contract money they don't have much incentive to field more than mediocre teams.  I think the current contract expires in 2020.

There's nothing wrong with having a different preference, it's about how you approach it, which should be as a team, e.g. 'Hey babe I love you but I have to be honest, I would have preferred a different style. How about we go shopping and split the cost of something we both love?' newlinechar  newlinechar Damn how hard was that.

It isn't the worst thing ever. They could do an Airbender, make all the protagonists super white and turn the evil characters into Indians. Frankly The Way of Kings is a super racially charged story. You have a racist elite society who use darkeyed slaves as meat fodder in their war against a bunch of blackish red natives. There are so many ways they could get this wrong, they could very well just make everyone white caucasians and not bother with the racial implications at all like with Doctor Strange.

En effet la baisse de pouvoir de l'√©glise est tr√®s ancienne en France,  le vrai combat entre l'√©glise et les anti-cl√©ricaux c'√©tait surtout dans les ann√©es 1900-1950. Pour avoir une id√©e du retentissement de ce ph√©nom√®ne au niveau des villages du sud de la France, tu devrais regarder des films de l'√©poque, je pense notamment aux films de Marcel Pagnol m√™me s'ils se passent passent plus √† l'est (la femme du boulanger, la gloire de mon p√®re) et aussi les films de Don Camillo (en Italie mais l'ambiance est similaire).

I would push for a tax internship since that's what you're interested in. An internship is great but if it's in a field that you're not interested in, I'm not sure it's worth it. I would begin to apply now for internships for the winter as that is when you'd learn the most. Also network your ass off and get to know people - not only so people know your name, but so you can figure out which firms you want to work at. newlinechar  newlinechar I did what you mentioned - interned in the winter and then started full time right after. If you can get an internship, I absolutely think your school would be open to give you course credit. At my school I actually got 6 credits for the internship.

Yeah I totally understand! It‚Äôs just different styles of code management. I don‚Äôt like our style of management and would prefer the one you have, however it allows for more control.  newlinechar  newlinechar Our large code base at work effectively has one main branch. When were assigned tasks we generate a new branch off of the main branch. Once we complete our task, our lead merges our branch into the main branch. The way I understand this is that larger corporate projects follow the same systematic approach. I could be wrong though because this is my first professional gig.

Oh, you're not wrong.  I'm in total agreement there.  I remember the feeling of disappointment when I realized there were only two actual towns/cities.

Humm... I prefer to think that we're just well past the 'golden era' of interstellar travel due to the the expansion of the universe and certain fundamental laws of physics as applied to our particular brand of energy gradient 'solution'. newlinechar  newlinechar There is, almost assuredly a point where the universe expands to the point where all life that emerges is isolated by distances too vast to comprehend, let alone navigate. newlinechar  newlinechar People forget (or are just plain ignorant) of the reality that the universe is only 14 billion years old and earth itself is only about 5 billion years old, with only the last couple of hundred million years being suitable for life.  That puts earth at roughly 10-13 billion years of universal expansion.  It gets confusing since the unit or measurement for the expansion of the universe is in 'kilometers per second per megaparsec' and nobody knows is we'll see a second 'golden era' and the universe reaches its 'big bang limit of elasticity' and begins to collapse in on itself and if that will even mean anything post 'heat death of the universe' which will inevitably happen as the elastic limit is approached. newlinechar  newlinechar Back of the envelope megaparsec localized, light travels roughly a billion kilometers per second while the universe travels outward at ~71km/s/mps.  The degenerate case is trying to get to a location on the opposite side of the big bang (assuming that the big bang was 'spherical'), which would double the 71km/s/mps.  That, of course, is ridiculous, so we're reduced to trying to figure out how fast we're separating from the narrowest conical slice of the sphere that houses planets capable of supporting life.

Don't agree with you there, the potential for a huge leap on 7nm completely outclasses current gen stuff.

My husband stays away during sex because they are so sensitive right now anyway. Hoping that goes back to normal when I'm done nursing. Since I don't see them as sexual I don't feel the need to censor my language about them. A breast or boob is the same as a hand, foot or arm.

&gt; The reason therapists illegally go against confidentiality in these situations is because of the stigma. Therapists are human and many of them (even with their education) don‚Äôt think that there can be non-offending pedophiles. They report them out of fear and the idea of ‚Äúprotecting the children‚Äù when the person who sought therapy has never touched a child and sought therapy for the express purpose of never touching a child. newlinechar  newlinechar Again, that would be a problem with false empirical beliefs among therapists, not a problem with removing stigma in society. We can fix this by educating therapists with data showing that there can be non-offending pedophiles. Or we could even try to educate society at large that pedophilic desires does not entail pedophilic actions. But none of this requires removing the stigma against such desires. Stigma is the result of disapproving *attitudes*. But the problems you mention here are the result of false *beliefs*. We can remove the latter without removing the former. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; I don‚Äôt think otherwise non-pedophilic people are going to suddenly want to have sex with children if we remove the stigma. newlinechar  newlinechar How do you explain the increase in homosexuality and other non-traditional sexualities within the past few decades? It is implausible to suggest that this increase is not at least somewhat the result of decreased stigma for these sexualities. I see no reason why pedophilia would be different if we removed the stigma. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; The whole point is that stigma or no, these people exist. And we don‚Äôt know what causes them to have these feelings. Do you know why you are straight/gay/whatever? Do you remember the moment you decided to be that way? No. Because you didn‚Äôt decide. You just were. Just like no one is going to decide to be a pedophile just because we may remove the stigma for seeking treatment. newlinechar  newlinechar Of course, sexuality is not some mere conscious choice. But that doesn't men societal norms can't influence an individual's sexuality on a subconscious level. Again, see my example with other non-traditional sexualities above.

Then it went silent and she drove past the yellow cardigan in the road and I knew something was up. I kept waiting for it to cut to the title card for a show or something. I remember it being a LOT longer too, I remember thinking I had been watching it for like half an hour by the time she was pointing at the chairs and the fourth one falls. It really stuck with me because there was no apparent explanation for it, IIRC normal programming resumed afterwards. I was so bewildered that I just went back to sleep.

It really does feel like Volume 3 was a brilliant culmination of things that resulted in an overextended and overambitious underprepared Volume 4 and 5. Volumes 4 and 5 have not had the time or ability to address leftover problems, and created new ones.  newlinechar  newlinechar It's clear that FMA or Avatar the Last Airbender are the types of shows RWBY wants to be. But FMA and Avatar both have weekly 22 minute episodes, and episodes upon episodes of them for worldbuilding and development...RWBY doesn't seem to have enough time to address everything, and in its attempt to address some of the things in Volume 5 it fumbles something _else_ up.

Well, kind of. Not all lumps in a breast are malignant or cancer. There are abscesses, fibroadenomas, lymph nodes, fatty tissues, etc. that you can occassionally feel. The problem is, even a trained physician can not tell you the difference by just feeling it. Until you are 40, unless you have a family history (or predetermined genetic disposition), it is almost always benign and a waste of time. The other issue is that mammogram itself isn't a perfect test and causes a lot of false positives. With each false positive, there are tons of follow-ups, biopsies, and a female + her family freaking out about possibly having cancer. There's no perfect answers, but the goal is to not do self exams to lower the burden on the medical industry and ease the anxiety for the females feeling the common lump or bump.  newlinechar  newlinechar That being said, ladies, if you ever see some change on the OUTSIDE of your breast, like nipple inverting, dimpling, bleeding, etc. see your physician. That is a tell-tale sign that something malignant may be ocurring.

Black people's hair is (typically) kinkier and more conducive to the kind of braids required for a weave, and weaves/sew ins can also a protective style which is something that is more necessary for kinkier hair.

Both of these classes use Excel because Solver gives easy and familiar access to an optimizer.   The fact the Solver is broken in LO Calc is likely the number one reason why it's not used for college econ classes and entry level engineering classes. newlinechar  newlinechar

What it is isn't incompetence. I honestly think Sledgehammer and Infinity Ward have been stretched thin for a while and have to play catch up, while Treyarch has been more or less together since the world at war days. WW2 feels like it was slapped together, but because they were forced to scrap AW2 when Activision saw the giant backlash towards jetpack games. So if it was put together under these circumstances I'd say it was a good job. But yeah I hope they get better at this as the life cycle of the game goes.

Excellent if you want to play as a pyro.  newlinechar 3.heide knight sword, personally I don't like the 1 hand move set but it's great for faith builds since it has lightning dmg and thus faith scaling.  newlinechar  newlinechar These two are obtained a bit later than the first 3 (they can be gotten in the first area) but they are really great for strength builds. 1. Greatsword, if you have watched/read berserk you'll get a Guts vibe from it.  newlinechar 2. The craftsman hammer, the first twinkling titanite weapon on the list and 3. The bandit axe. One of my new favorites. A great weapon for hybrids w a fairly low requirement of 18 str and 10 dex (I think). It has great base dmg and scaling so infusions are great for it.  newlinechar  newlinechar Also a heads up, pyro dmg scales w int/faith. There is also a new type of dmg, dark/hexes. These scale of your lowest out of int/faith but it gets a bigger bonus than things like strength. 
I used to love my guns too but I got wildly suicidal a few years ago so I gave my guns to the cops. Best decision I ever made. I can get them back at the end of 2018 but I don‚Äôt think I will even though I‚Äôm not suicidal anymore.

This just shows how you don't play online so of course the grind doesn't make a difference to you. Having maxed attributes and badges by no means gives you the ability to compete with the best on its own. Everyone had max players last year and your actual skill was the difference.

I've always felt there was something sincere in his reaction, and maybe he tacked on the face bit at the end to mask sincerity or maybe he actually felt there was something wrong with his face or physicality despite looking average because of bullying or abuse.  newlinechar  newlinechar To me, that fact that he gave that victim a blanket etc and treated her with slightly more 'kindness' (don't like using the word here but you know), tells me that she struck a nerve. He had no real need to shift his behaviour slightly towards her, in order to mislead etc - many people would assume his crimes stemmed from feelings of inadequacy or powerlessness without him implying that by treating someone slightly better when she validates him. I think that victim read the situation and decided she could potentially save her life by appealing to ego - I think the appeal hit the right nerve.

&gt; in that case renewables loose hard because the materials for them are strip mined in China, which does incredible amounts of damage to the local environment. newlinechar  newlinechar Key word being 'local.'  As in, not global.  Not even regional.  And as I mentioned, once it's out of the ground, it will remain in service indefinitely with minimal externality due to recycling.   newlinechar  newlinechar I don't see by what logic you accuse that of even being *comparable* to - let alone worse than - something that does **global** environmental damage at every single point along the supply chain, and then ceases to exist as a useful commodity at the end of that chain.  newlinechar  newlinechar Moreover, China's role is temporary.  Rare metals are all over the planetary crust because they come from asteroid impacts.  The only reason China dominates now is because they're the ones investing the most in developing the mining, but *any* and *every* country has the resources.   newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; But you don't care about that because you're a westerner who will never go there. newlinechar  newlinechar I care that China's people can barely breathe because of all the fossil fuel pollution in their air.  Which is a big reason why they're investing so heavily in renewables.

There is less chance for racial profiling and error if every citizen has an ID proof of citizenship. newlinechar * Severe penalties for business who hire illegal labor. newlinechar  newlinechar EDIT: There was also a bipartisan attempt for comprehensive immigation reform :https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Security,_Economic_Opportunity,_and_Immigration_Modernization_Act_of_2013#Senate newlinechar  newlinechar It passed in the Senate, but the House chose not to go to conference on the bill, stating that border security was a higher priority. newlinechar  newlinechar I personally like the bill, since it compromises giving more options for those skilled and unskilled workers who wish to move to the US while providing for more border security.

Ok. So if he heard that and accepts it, you should not still be hearing 'because maybe I might want to have another' as reasoning from him. You do not want to have any more children, period. So go ahead and do whatever you need to do. If he wants to have another child, he is going to have figure out himself if he wants to leave and be with someone else who wants to have a child, or stay and accept not having any more children. But you do not need (nor should you) give up your autonomy in this situation. Having or not having kids is unfortunately one of those topics that I just don't believe you can really come to a compromise on. Either you are both on the same page, or you are not right for each other. I'm not saying you and your husband aren't right for each other, but you definitely need to make sure you position is crystal clear and do not waver on it. Then the ball is in his court.

The question was 'Can a person rationally believe that ‚Äòno one has a right to my body without my consent‚Äô while also believing that they have a right to a nonhuman animal‚Äôs body (particularly when not using an animal out of sheer desperation)?' To me, this question is essentially equating human and animal rights because it's framed as 'if you support x human right then why don't you support x as an animal right.'  newlinechar  newlinechar Yes, you have the right to kill and eat the pig. Why do you have that right? Because the pig is not guaranteed the right to life, and no law preventing the consumption of animal protein. A pig does not have the same right as a human and again you are implying that they do (or should) by stating by asking 'kill that pig when you have other options and then turn around and say that no one can come harm you when they have other options?' Why would I be subjected to what happened to the pig unless I and the pig had the same legal standing to life?  newlinechar  newlinechar Further, this raises the question that why would the pig only have a right to life if it was standing next to a healthy plant-based meal. If it was not, would you still be to you morally indefensible to slaughter and consume it?

I mainly just wanted a portable inverter. I work with commercial led installation and sometimes I may need to test the functionality of a fixture where I don't have access to power, like say on a pole light 30ft on a scissor lift that has no power because the timers or photocells haven't tripped them on. With this I can just plug the light directly into the inverter where I'm at to see if it works. A battery inverter has other uses though. Access to AC at around 50 watts can be useful in a power outage.  newlinechar  newlinechar As for the variable power supply aspect, there are many uses for that so long as you tinker with electronics. When it comes to flashlights and leds in particular, sometimes it's good to be able to tell at exactly what voltage an led will begin to illuminate for example. It also serves as a way to dim lighting. So if I wanted to I could hook any number of lighting modules with varying voltages to this thing and be able to drive it any at level from low to high just by adjusting the output voltage.   newlinechar  newlinechar I should have made a video but it was a spur of the moment project I only thought of taking pics of after completion. Either way just look at it like this:  You can buy 30v variable DC power supplies that can handle 5A at 30v for around $50 or so, and that's not bad.. but not everyone really needs that. The most I've ever done is charge a 24v battery bank with it (and now a 29v bank). Most people just need light troubleshooting capability and won't need to feed anything more than a few amps. In that case they might as well buy a $2 buck circuit and just add everything else themselves. newlinechar  newlinechar

No, and tbh gender studies degrees are pretty bogus. Usually it's a psychologist or a therapist that's worked with trans patients in the past and has spent a long time cultivating a knowledge of dealing with gender identity issues. newlinechar  newlinechar They don't convince the childen to 'maim' themselves. In fact, most of the time it's a dry and clinical diagnosis of the patient in question. Do they actually have gender identity issues or is it other body image issues? Would HRT or SRS actually help the patient or would it just be a bandaid for other issues that are mistaken for gender identity issues? Those kinds of things and those kind of questions. In my case, my parents had nothing to do with it and I'm sure 90% of the time that's the case as well. The parents you see doing horrible shit to their kids and parents horribly fucking up their kid's brains are a radical minority and they shouldn't be the image of the entire trans community at large.

It's better to broach the topic seriously, instead of casually mentioning it after sex. newlinechar  newlinechar I know it sounds tough, but slipping it into a compliment sandwich doesn't making it easier for him, it only makes it easier for *you*.

Banks are not going out looking for customer deposits to then loan out as you seem to think. The Bank of England published a report that is quite clear on this. newlinechar  newlinechar If you have an asset such as a home worth $1m, and go to ask for a loan of $500,000, the bank does not check if they have $500k to lend you, they simply credit your account for $500k and 'create a deposit', the condition is that they can only create credit for a matching amount of collateral, which in this case is only 50% loan to value so easily covered. newlinechar  newlinechar From the customer perspective, your new asset created (the new bank account balance) is matched by a liability (the mortgage). From the banks side, the liability (bank account balance) is matched by the asset (your home). newlinechar  newlinechar The assets and liabilities all balance out to zero (disregarding interest). newlinechar  newlinechar Loans create deposits. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar

Can't say he was a lousy President when you realize what his administration inherited. His administration inherited an economy in a recession and two wars. A third war was started on ISIS. I'd say that he was constantly facing more hurdles than any other president based solely on the reason that he was black. Trump doesn't have America's interests at heart. He has corporations interests at heart. He's not looking out for America, he's selling America off little by little to the highest bidder. The rest of his party isn't worth a shit either. He's just another corporate puppet. His stances are based solely on the interests of corporations backing him. He's president because corrupt corporations and political campaign donors let him be. They saw him as a the weak link to push their political agenda and he fell for the bait. Trump will do anything if you stroke his ego enough.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar

Is VimScript any better (serious question, I'd love to see some technical comparisons or benchmarks if they exist). At least we have async plugins now so for example, the entire UI doesn't lock up anymore when a plugin is doing something.

Think you're better of listing things that could be improved upon rather than the things they got right. Not to be a dick but because they got a whole lot more right than wrong. Things that really disappointed me is that the Kill Counter + Clan Tag change to the weapon holder's one, rather than the weapon's owner. And the lack of being able to put your Emblem on your weapon, Paintjob makes it very difficult to make something mildly detailed because of the lack of zoom. Plus some weapons just can't be painted on that well.

I came to argue with you that James more of a Draco parallel ('I'd leave, wouldn't you?' on the train), but you made such amazing points I don't even want to??!! I haven't seen an analysis of Sirius I loved so much in quite a while. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; . Sirius, however, feels the Black name differently - that it's sort of an albatross that he needs to refute. However, his confidence and arrogance still has the same source - from family grooming their next heir. As he grows to separate from his family, he doesn't just express Gryffindor pride, he needs to live and prove it - leading up to insulting and bullying Slytherins like Snape. newlinechar  newlinechar YES SO MUCH YES. Everything about Sirius comes down to rebelling against and living down his name. The only thing I might add to this point that differentiates him and Draco is that I get the distinct impression that Sirius's parents were not anywhere near as doting and loving a Draco's. I can't imagine Narcissa (or Lucius, really) ever talking to Draco like Walburga's portrait talks to Sirius or burning his name off of a wall. ‚ÄúBlood traitor, abomination, shame of my flesh!‚Äù is amusing at first, but so horrible when you imagine that's his *mother* saying that. I would guess that his initial dislike of his family comes from having distant, awful parents. newlinechar  newlinechar I also think the paragraph above has a good deal to do with why he clings to James (and James's beliefs) so utterly. James, with his worship of Gryffindor and the nobility and honor that comes from it, is everything his family is not. Not to say that Sirius does not come to genuinely believe that pureblood mania is BS, but it's got to come from somewhere, right? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Sirius clearly has a huge chip on his shoulder because of his family background. It's natural that Snape hates Sirius the most because Sirius has everything Snape wants - the family name, pureblood status, wealth, likeability - and Sirius throws it away. On the other hand, Sirius can't understand why Snape, who didn't grow up with the same crazy family (and knowing nothing of Snape's actual childhood) and who has a muggleborn friend, would buy into the pureblood mania to begin with. Sirius had to prove he was different from Snape and people like Snape. James did not. newlinechar  newlinechar This is so insightful. Thank you. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; I wouldn't be surprised if an adult James would have found himself siding with Lupin a lot more over Sirius in terms of letting bygones be bygones and growing up. newlinechar  newlinechar Oh yes, I can see this. I wouldn't actually be surprised if James at 21 would have also done so -- had they not been in hiding and in a terrible war situation. newlinechar

It's a bit out there for football but does the A-League go down the path of having a draft?

Your DH clearly told you that he doesn't have a plan to protect you or your child from his mother. That means you have to make a plan, and it just include as a contingency, what your plan is if he endangers you and your child by sharing information or allowing contact with his mother. I strongly suggest you actually type it up and tape it where he can see it. It will also be comforting to have a plan.  newlinechar  newlinechar For example:  newlinechar  newlinechar MIL shows up at the door: begin recording. Verbally tell her to leave. If she refuses, call the police and tell them 'a mentally disturbed woman with a history of addiction and violence against me is refusing to leave my door. I'm trapped in my house with my baby, and I'm scared. She has said the following threats (X,YZ) and she's done stuff like that before, so she will again. Please be careful when you arrive, she's not afraid to get physical with cops.' 
Highly doubt it will end up like that, TBH.

&gt;The 'jews' behind big-banks and the media are enemies of Judaism (that's why they attack Israel via the media all the time).

Yeah, that's what's weird about.   My mother made enough money to provide for us, but she was bad with money.   No drugs, no alcohol.  And she had just divorced my father and moved to a different state with 5 kids, so I do appreciate her efforts, absolutely. newlinechar  newlinechar Part of the problem was that she only got paid once a month, instead of twice.  So you have to be twice as good at shopping, economizing, storing, planning... and if you're not, then you have enough for like three weeks, and then that last week is a struggle. newlinechar  newlinechar And actually, there wasn't much rationing or discipline, so actually, we would splurge for like a week, and then the 2nd and 3rd week would be much more rationed, and then the 4th week was just whatever scraps we had left. newlinechar  newlinechar You could take somebody with less money than my mom made (she worked with computers, and even in the early 1980s, she was getting decent month.  Not crazy money, but decent), who is much better at planning and executing that plan, and this problem would not have existed.
I don't think the accent is the problem, I think British singers of today who sing in those accents are just genuinely terrible who are probably forcing it to add some form of personality to their music, otherwise it wouldn't have any. Lily Allen is a good example,Scouting For Girls and Kaiser Chiefs are another. However, I can think of some examples of good ones, Charlie Fink from Noah and the Whale for instance. He does twinge to American sometimes, but for the most part he's from the midlands and it's a hard accent to shake, so it comes through, especially in 5 Years Time.

Well there are about 3.6 billion options for a straight male. probably 1-2 billion of those are asian, stop worrying about the ethnicity and just focus on the girls personality and developing a close friendship with the person you date in the future.  newlinechar  newlinechar I read some of your previous posts and I understand you have autism, bear in mind that advice you get in the internet isn't going to be as helpful as advice you'll get from people who know you, your family and friends.  newlinechar  newlinechar It's important for you to realise that nobody is going to conform fully to what you want in a relationship, this is why personality is the most important facet of any relationship, without compatible personalities it won't work in the long run no matter how hard you try or try to conform to what she wants in a relationship... This is true irrespective of ethnicity. If you find asian girls attractive and want to pursue them thats perfectly fine but you shouldn't pursue a particular girl for the sole reason that she is asian, you should evaluate how well you get on, how compatible you two are and how much she likes you also.

It's a nightmare, frankly, no matter what position you're in with it. newlinechar  newlinechar I think what frustrates me the most is how many times I repeat the same conversation over and over trying to explain it to the other side. I would say cis, but people not comfortable with the lingos seem to think it's an insult, instead of simply meaning you've never sat there and seriously debated if you would be happier as the other sex. newlinechar  newlinechar Because to most people in the Navy, trans just means you're mentally unstable because you want different genitalia. They think we don't serve well or are even capable of serving well because for those of us who haven't transitioned or aren't in the process, we couldn't possibly be trans, so they have no qualms openly espousing their view point on how we shouldn't be allowed to serve to us when they consider us friends and it never enters their heads that they may be throwing blanket judgements on the very person they're speaking to. newlinechar  newlinechar But I do serve. I've served eight years and four deployments and I like to think I'm reasonably good at it. I know I'm certainly committed to doing the best I can at it, and I cannot say that I've had a smooth run so far. But we tough it out. newlinechar  newlinechar In ways, having the option makes it both better and worse, because (and I know I'm strange for this) I really do believe in this institution, in the Navy. Not that it's perfect, or even great, but that it has the potential to be great, to be a positive example for the rest of the world, and I very much want to be a part of making that happen. newlinechar  newlinechar I've had to choose between that and my frustration with having to check 'F' in the box, and it's a frustration I've been dealing with for over ten years now. Not only that, but now I'm losing friends over it, simply because they can't level my being a hard charger with tits over my genuine wish that I didn't have them. newlinechar  newlinechar It doesn't make me any different than the person they already know. It doesn't make me less capable. It just means I wish I didn't have tits, something that- by instruction- I, and not the military, was always going to have to pay for. But somehow that's a personal affront, and no one can explain to me why.

So in your view we should abolish all education, and let doctors be qualified based on what? Their assurance that they spent enough time self-teaching in a library that they know how to fix you without killing you? newlinechar  newlinechar There are two major problems with your view that I see. newlinechar  newlinechar The first is that not everyone learns in the way you describe. You're describing an extremely self-motivated person. Those sorts of people are not the majority. There are plenty of people who want to learn, but have trouble when given so little direction and oversight. There are also those who think they'd rather not learn anything, but find their lives vastly improved by having done so. Add to this that we would most likely be talking about children, and the amount of self-motivated learners goes down even more. How would children be taught to read or do arithmetic if they were left to their own devices? Surely they would choose to play instead? newlinechar  newlinechar But perhaps by education, you mean secondary or post secondary education, which brings me to my second point. Without an education system with certain standards, the necessary experts don't come with the guarantees that they should. If Doctors are left to self-learn, there's a good chance they'll miss something important. If Architects are left to self-learn, then the building they design may collapse and kill people. It's important that our experts know what they're doing, important enough that we as a community should ensure it.
I don't know why you're conflating what I'm saying with what other people were saying before those fights and then calling it revisionist history That's a major fallacy. I've been consistent about Eddie being an extremely weak champ. I was saying that before he got his shit pushed in by McGregor. He looked like dogshit against Pettis and Melendez and barely scrapped past them in the most underwhelming of performances. I'm not holding the one fight against him but I'm certainly not extrapolating that he's on Khabib on Ferguson's level because he beat up Eddie Alvarez. It's one data point. newlinechar  newlinechar Frankly, I regard his fights against Diaz as data points as well. I don't really care that Nate was blown up and fighting with a soft midsection. You do realize that Nate missed weight by 5 pounds when he fought RDA at LW right? He looked exactly like he did against Conor and Dos Anjos kicked his ass effortlessly. Conor on the other hand lost to him on 11 days notice after prepping for a title fight and then scraped past him in the a majority decision. At the end of the day, Nate was a blown-up lightweight.  newlinechar  newlinechar To say, McGregor is as good as Khabib and Ferguson based on the above is crazy to me.

There are a lot of houses out there right now that have no garage at all, or no driveway, or an otherwise similar situation.

Lenin was possibly the one with the closest understanding of objective histpory and the structure of the USSR was so fashioned. Which is why it stayed true to the core logic of Communist Manifesto even as Mao was quickly unravelling the 'Chinese Revolution' to set up shop for Walmart. BUT. Scientific socialists are not pedantic. We can for example see the value in Trump as an agent for progress even though many would not agree (I am not a Tortskyite. I am not anything other than a scientist). On that basis, I would actively push for Trump not because any of these delusional liberals still carry Lenins mantle but only because they are delusional fools who will land us in trouble if they are not kept away from power till they learn. And Islam is the riskiest issue they cannot be entrusted with.

I'm not trying to convince you or anyone to enjoy gambling. If it's not for you then it's not for you. I just wanted to provide a different pov.

If you lose over half of the energy you make, that means you burn over twice as much fuel. More fuel burnt, more green house gases. So, no, they are not as sound as they can possibly get. 40% thermal efficiency is only the absolute latest and greatest. Most cars average 20% efficiency. 
I adore the 3DS, and as a portable option I prefer it. However the technology is quite dated at this point and part of me would prefer to see a new dedicated handheld rather than more new 3DS games. However I also don't believe it'd be wise to introduce a new dedicated handheld as the Switch plays that role for many owners.
We're so fragile. Whenever a team takes it to us hard, with solid forechecking and not giving us breathing room, we just crumble.

I'll be honest, I have no idea how functions work. I just assumed he was being the smartest of all the smart people. 
Yeah, but realistically, it's not about the value of the dollar as much as it is about the relative value of income vs. cost of living, which appears to allow even low income families here to have a higher quality of life on what we consider minimum wage. We also seem to have better systems in place for things like welfare and healthcare (although our welfare system is not great lately - they started automating big chunks of it which assigned people huge undeserved debts, which isn't great especially considering it was targetting those in need) - however, I'm not super educated on the US equivalents and I haven't lived through them, so I'm not sure what the pros/cons are comparatively except anecdotally. Even if you account for the dollar value difference or whatever, it's undeniable that being able to see a doctor or have government support while you search for a job, or welfare rent assistance (which low income families are often eligible for here), is a HUGE factor in how a low income family can budget for themselves. Taking that into account, $12,000 here can be very different from $12,000 there, even if you allow for exchange rates. newlinechar  newlinechar Besides, our minimum wage for a full time job at 38 hours per week is $36k/year before tax. After tax, that becomes $32k/year. Accounting for the current exchange rate, that becomes roughly $25k/year after tax in USD. newlinechar So having a minimum wage that's half of that in a super power first-world country seems pretty fucked up to me. newlinechar  newlinechar I mean, shit, I grew up in a family with a single widowed parent who also had a terminal illness and was unable to work at all and 3 siblings, and with supplementary income from me when I was a teenager (which still left me with enough pocket cash to spend on little treats for myself here and there), I still feel like my family grew up in less poverty than some of the stories I hear about low income families in the US.
That is absolutely what happened.

So WoW started declining after its first expansion is what you're saying? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;You'd roll into an area with your alt and find that guy that was ganking you, and you take your vengeance. newlinechar  newlinechar How has that changed? I literally had to do this, a month ago while levelling. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; You can't be blacklisted for ninja looting. newlinechar  newlinechar Oh ok, so is that a perk you look for in an MMO? on the back of the box: You can ninja loot!. What MMO offers that nowadays? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Now leveling is mindless. Nobody knows you. You can't be blacklisted for ninja looting. You don't run into other raid parties and break out in war. You don't have PVP groups recognized and feared. There is no travel, just menus. newlinechar  newlinechar Levelling becomes a smaller part of the game in a theme park MMO, that is a given that every theme park suffers because of flaws in its design. That can't be helped.  newlinechar  newlinechar So you don't every see raid groups forming outside a raid instance after 2006? That seems silly. Theres still plenty of travel, and like I said, look at the other big subscription MMO, FFXIV, where you're literally able to teleport to every zone in the game, that doesnt seem to affect their game or community. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;The reason people want vanilla, and miss old WoW isn't because of 'the cool new boss'. And wanting access to it. They miss it because so many interactions and experiences are now gone from the game because of the changes they made. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't mind people missing or wanting Vanilla, but a lot of these changes are absolutely inevitable to stay competitive in the genre. Otherwise this discussion we'd be talking about WoW dying because they never adapted or changed to the needs of the changing playerbase. newlinechar  newlinechar The same things you're complaining about what has changed in WoW, other MMOs have been doing absolutely fantastic doing the same decisions. Meanwhile other games that cling onto those old ways?

Eh, Section 8 is similar but a little different in that landlords generally have to fight tooth and nail to get any kind of reimbursement for damages to property that Sec 8 tenants do. Landlords do, however, have to perform prompt repairs to keep everything up to standard if there's an issue with the property that, legally, the landlord is responsible for. newlinechar  newlinechar I have seen cases like you describe--where tenants have torn doors off (and worse)--where landlords just had to eat the cost of replacing those doors because HUD refused to reimburse. HUD also tends to undervalue rentals: the market value on the apartment that I live in is in the $1200/mo range but if my apartments accepted Sec 8, HUD wouldn't pay more than $800-900 (I get a discount due to being a disabled veteran, but that's a choice the company that owns and manages the property has made). Also, HUD properties in many cities here tend to be crime-ridden and in bad neighborhoods, and properties in 'good' neighborhoods deliberately do not accept HUD as a selling point. newlinechar  newlinechar Many properties do not accept HUD vouchers/stopped accepting HUD vouchers because of the undervaluing and damage to property that HUD does not reimburse. I used to manage several properties for a friend and he stopped accepting HUD for this reason: only received 2/3 (at best) of market value and could not make tenants pay for damage to property, nor could he get HUD to reimburse him for damage that their tenants did. newlinechar  newlinechar Personally, sometimes I think the UK system might be better than the clusterfuck we have here.
Yep, I saw it yesterday and I laughed my ass off.

That's what I was trying to say, but I admit it didn't come off that way. 
And they shouldn't. What happens in your scenario when a lawsuit depletes an entire department's budget? Is there just no law enforcement until the next fiscal year?

While typically I agree with you, he's using it as a boosted EQ thing blended in to his main Archon tone. It sounds MAD. it's like chainsaw and then some.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar It fits the material, which is really fast a lot and normal HM-2 full on loses that at times. This way we still get the chainsaw when we play mosh riffs but retain articulation on riffy stuff.
As much as riding is a solo activity, there's no way to maintain or adjust bikes without talking to people, going on YouTube, going on forums, downloading manuals, etc.  newlinechar  newlinechar You can buy a Honda Civic and drive it work every day and never know how it works. You buy a CBR300, within two weeks you're going to be asking how to adjust the preload, how to adjust the chain, what people mean by adjusting the play in the clutch, and what are the fun roads to ride.
I already think the subreddit is horrific
I think he had to go as well, but like I said I think if luck was playing and he had a decent defense and grison wasn't such a fuck up, we'd have a different football perspective on him going into week 17 
Let me guess: we've never left Earth's atmosphere?
AMC has the Stubs program, they have a free program that gives very little points (don't remember specifics but pretty terrible), if you pay $15 a year you get the Premium status, which means every $50 you spend on anything, you get $5 reward you can use for a ticket purchase, concessions, or anything else they may sell. You can buy anything at concessions with points, whereas Regal is only popcorn or soda. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't have Cinemark so cannot comment on them. newlinechar  newlinechar As for gaining points at concessions - I don't think either program will limit you at concessions - you pay with your own money there, so the cashiers will not see your MoviePass card, thus there should not be any objection to earning points via concession purchases. Only if some other program started a 'ConcessionsPass' that you weren't paying your own money for. newlinechar 
Yes. But generally when you pay in cash you're seeing and touching your product. If I buy your couch off Craigslist for cash, I can touch it and smell it and make sure I actually physically have it. If you physically take my money and steal the couch, I can report you to the local cops with a description of you and shit.   newlinechar  newlinechar If a merchant takes your XRB and *poofs*, you have no recourse. Especially if they're in another country. 'OK your shipment will be delivered in 4-5 business days!' - you check in 8 days and it isn't there. You go to their website and it's just gone. Checkmate.   newlinechar  newlinechar It's like paying with cash if you had to trust people you've never seen to give you stuff you've never seen with your cash. I'd trust Amazon, but maybe not Etsy.   newlinechar  newlinechar I don't believe Rai can make smart contracts for this service, either. I will have to look into it more. If not, we just need an abstraction layer on top of this to ensure that smart contracts are possible, or that there is recourse for fraudulent merchants.   newlinechar  newlinechar It just needs time. Until then, some trust will be involved. I like it.
A lot more green lights. Unlike Lorde, I don't need it or want it. newlinechar  newlinechar We're still alive which is good so 2018 is a million times better than 2017.
Getting rid of Dirk now is not a good move.  Let him have another year, we are a young talented team in need of an oline.  I don't want to be a coaching carousel team.  If anything get rid of Mike Smith.

At a guess... because it makes them seem smart/worldly/sophisticated?   newlinechar  newlinechar Or computer game players are just nerds (I can say that, since I am one).
&gt; they were scared of zeke, that is why the pass game worked. newlinechar  newlinechar Yeah.  I remember Dak's '100 yard pass' last year.  It was a short screen to the left to Zeke.  I remember Zeke's 32 yard rush TD against the Steelers.&amp;nbsp; newlinechar  newlinechar It's a 53 person game.  But if Dak gets the sole credit for some of our 2016 wins, Zeke damn well deserves sole credit for a few wins himself.

No, that's all you need to do. I was notified via email but Google sometimes calls too.
Never forget it!!!
Every game is a must win. The fact that he hasn't personally somehow found a way to squeeze out a few more wins here and there doesn't prevent him from being elite. The fact that he has over 4000 yards and 25 tds in each of the last 3 seasons makes him one of the best QBs in the league right now, and the best QB that the Redskins have had in my lifetime (I'm 37). If he's making more money than you think he should, blame the front office for jerking him around. But as for reasons why this team isn't in the playoffs, Cousins is just about at the bottom of my list.
Anne gets off on power, not admiration.
He was not laying off the Pepsi.
I am aware of that.
It's not so much as equalizing as it is density manipulation, basically compressing atoms (Pym says it changes atomic relative distance) to become so dense. newlinechar  newlinechar Not sure, but my guess is Scott temporarily accumulates mass when he grows giant by taking in the molecules around him (air molecules for instance) and the blue Pym Particles somehow makes his body bond with these at the same time it changes atomic relative distance between the particles making up his body, creating a stable proportion. The suit protects Scott from losing molecular integrity or something. newlinechar  newlinechar That's why he says in Civil War that he passes out after he goes giant: he expels these extra molecules he had accumulated earlier. In the Avengers Assemble cartoon, he says he passes out, but it's shown he 'drools' after (he denies this first when T'Challa asks, because he was embarrassed anyone would find out his drooling problem), in the comics, he says he throws up after, so there is basis that MCU Scott also is prone to throwing up after. newlinechar  newlinechar But I think the bigger question is that when he becomes small, his mass is inconsistent. His body becomes super dense, but Conservation of Mass should mean he doesn't lose mass. newlinechar  newlinechar It's no wonder why no one could work out the formula-- Pym must have found several important scientific breakthroughs to get there. No wonder he's so secretive about it. newlinechar  newlinechar TL;DR: Pym Particles, How do they Work?
awesome :D
Thanks, and same to you :)
That's why I asked. Do the companies do well? I can't imagine they were completely excluded of the insane inflation.

Exactly - But this post is about the future, not present, which is why I think it‚Äôs important to note. 
They can cut back on things and get aid from the government and other friends and family for 4 years.   newlinechar  newlinechar Op is 21, a couple  years ago they didn‚Äôt even have income from op, and had to take care of him/her. They just need to fend for themselves. They can sell their house or rent a smaller place with one less adult. They will manage. People are very resilient. newlinechar  newlinechar It‚Äôs not easy but op staying at home wasting away their life at a dead end job isn‚Äôt what a good parent wants for their kid anyways.

You put your finger on something interesting.  Writers who kill characters off for impact often find that the audience walls itself off from caring too much for the characters in the first place.   Because we're reasonably sure that the heroes won't die,  we can afford to invest emotionally in them and care about what happens to them, how they feel about it and what they do next. 
I hire vets exclusively. If you dont have an Honorable Discharge you will not be considered. Its an unspoken perk that goes to my fellow veterans.

I agree. I can‚Äôt drink sugary drinks either.  newlinechar  newlinechar I was drinking kombucha yesterday, and I was surprised at how sweet it tasted to me, considering when I went vegan a few months ago it tasted much more bitter. 
You know they can both be hot garbage right? That Cam missing throws doesn't excuse Shula from being unable to design a functional short passing game with the most prolific receiving back in the league to work with while other teams take UDFAs a manage dinky dunky game management offenses with QBs several tiers of skill lower than Cam every year, right?

Not really, because I actually LIKE real misery. It's just the right amount of difficulty, but as long as you are willing to adapt and change the way you play it is still quite possible to complete. newlinechar This just seems like overly difficult with little to no payoff in the enjoyment of learning it.

&gt; I think for (non-housing) investment you can only claim deductions on income earned from the actual investment. newlinechar  newlinechar Not quite true. newlinechar  newlinechar I had an investment account a few years ago. Any interest charged on the money used to fund the investment account was able to be used as a tax deduction (Looking at the tax return, seems to be in the order of 30%) newlinechar  newlinechar So theoretically, I could borrow money from the bank to fund an investment in bitcoin. IIRC, the borrowing would need to be classed as an investment loan, and not simply be money taken from an existing non-investment loan. Any interest charged by the bank on the money I borrowed could be claimed as a tax deduction. I would then typically be hit with CGT when I cashed in the bitcoins. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: I'm pretty sure there are numerous rules about what you can and cant invest in to be able to claim deductions, but its definitely not limited to housing investment.
I mean, if they wanted to stop smurfing, aren't there more effective ways? Like to play competitive, an account would need a registered email/phone number? newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar If someone wants to smurf there isn't much stopping them. This might allow them to 'get to the rank they belong' faster, but what's going to stop them from just making a new smurf and doing it again and again? I don't think the problem is how long smurfs stay at lower ranks, I think the problem is the intent to smurf at all.
I will paraphrase what I saw someone said to me ' Iron is forged in the heart of a sun, so you can't hurt it go nuts' newlinechar  newlinechar You can make all the mistakes and you wont hurt that pan.

Basically as long as you dont fill your sink with icy water heat the pan up then dunk it a few times you are golden.  newlinechar  newlinechar Go buy a pound of bacon, and go nuts man. Just make sure you take lots of pictures so we can cheer your nonkosher success or guide you away from what made your failure. (PS the failure is unlikely)
I'd say the chairs were more violent. The cage fall wa more spectacular, but it wasn't anywhere near as brutal as multiple chair shots were. They still try and do spots off the cage. No one is allowed to do chair shots like that anymore in the WWE.
